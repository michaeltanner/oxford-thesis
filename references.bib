	abstract = {Combined high-frequency transthoracic ultrasound, pulsed Doppler and color flow mapping were used to image and assess blood flow velocity in the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD) in 56 consecutive patients. All patients subsequently underwent coronary angiography. The LAD was imaged in 19 patients (34\%), and the diameter was measured in 12 with high-quality images (mean diameter 1.8 mm {\textpm} 0.08). In 1 patient, the penetrating branches of the LAD were imaged. The distal LAD appeared normal by ultrasound in 18 patients, and a significant stenosis was detected in 1; angiography confirmed the ultrasound findings. There were no false negative results. Characteristic biphasic flow with higher velocities in diastole were noted in all 19 patients. Color flow mapping demonstrated normal laminar flow, except in the patient with a distal stenosis. Pulsed Doppler confirmed an increased velocity distal to the stenosis in this patient. This study is the first transthoracic evaluation of the hemodynamic effects of a coronary artery stenosis, and the first in vivo description of blood flow disturbance at a distal coronary stenosis in humans. The clinical use of this technique is limited, because only the distal portion of the LAD is visualized. However, it may provide a noninvasive means of assessing distal LAD diameter and blood flow, and changes in these parameters under a variety of physiologic, pharmacologic and interventional stimuli.},

	abstract = {Statistical models have shown considerable promise as a basis for segmenting and interpreting cardiac images. While a variety of statistical models have been proposed to improve the segmentation results, most of them are either static models (SMs), which neglect the temporal dynamics of a cardiac sequence, or generic dynamical models (GDMs), which are homogeneous in time and neglect the intersubject variability in cardiac shape and deformation. In this paper, we develop a subject-specific dynamical model (SSDM) that simultaneously handles temporal dynamics (intrasubject variability) and intersubject variability. We also propose a dynamic prediction algorithm that can progressively identify the specific motion patterns of a new cardiac sequence based on the shapes observed in past frames. The incorporation of this SSDM into the segmentation framework is formulated in a recursive Bayesian framework. It starts with a manual segmentation of the first frame, and then segments each frame according to intensity information from the current frame as well as the prediction from past frames. In addition, to reduce error propagation in sequential segmentation, we take into account the periodic nature of cardiac motion and perform segmentation in both forward and backward directions. We perform "leave-one-out" test on 32 canine sequences and 22 human sequences, and compare the experimental results with those from SM, GDM, and active appearance motion model (AAMM). Quantitative analysis of the experimental results shows that SSDM outperforms SM, GDM, and AAMM by having better global and local consistencies with manual segmentation. Moreover, we compare the segmentation results from forward and forward-backward segmentation. Quantitative evaluation shows that forward-backward segmentation suppresses the propagation of segmentation errors.},

Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation has reached satisfactory results for the long-term treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, but not for the treatment of LSP atrial fibrillation. Several approaches with various outcomes have been described in the literature. The purpose of this review is to summarize the ablation approach that we developed at our institution., Recent findings: During ablation of LSP atrial fibrillation, in addition to pulmonary vein antrum and posterior wall isolation, ablation of nonpulmonary vein triggers disclosed by high dosage of isoproterenol seems to be of utmost importance to achieve long-term success after a single procedure. The location of the nonpulmonary vein triggers includes the coronary sinus, the anterior part of the septum, the left atrial appendage and the superior vena cava. Termination of atrial fibrillation during ablation does not seem to influence the outcome. Increasing radiofrequency power from 30 up to 45 W seems an important factor to favour durable lesions., Summary: The approach described in this review will guide the reader to what we believe is the best approach for the ablation of patients with LSP atrial fibrillation., (C) 2013 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

In addition, problems with baseline drift, motion artifacts and muscular noise are minimised. The performance of the algorithm was tested using standard ECG waveform records from the MIT-BITH Arrhythmia database. An average detection rate of 99.87\%, a sensitivity (Se) of 99.94\% and a positive prediction (+P) of 99.93\% have been achieved against study records from the MIT-BITH Arrhythmia database.

	abstract = {Aims
To evaluate whether comprehensive evaluation of coronary anatomy and delayed enhancement (DE) by multidetector-computed tomography (MDCT) would allow determination of etiology of left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) as compared with coronary angiography (CA) and DE-magnetic resonance (CMR).

Methods and results
Seventy-one consecutive patients (50 males, 59 {\textpm} 16 years) with LVD (ejection fraction: 26 {\textpm} 11\%) of unknown etiology underwent MDCT, LGE (late Gd-DTPA-enhanced)-CMR and CA. Patients were classified into four groups according to coronary artery disease (CAD) by CA and LGE-CMR patterns. Patients (n = 24) with CAD and transmural or sub-endocardial DE by CMR were considered having definite ischaemic LVD (group 1). Patients (n = 36) without CAD by CA and with no/atypical LGE-CMR were considered non-ischaemic LVD (group 2). Further we identified four patients with transmural DE but no CAD (group 3) and seven patients with CAD but no DE (group 4). On per-patient basis, combined coronary and DE-MDCT had excellent agreement ($\kappa$ = 0.89; P {\textless} 0.001) with CA/LGE-CMR to classify patients into the same four groups. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of MDCT were 97, 92 and 94\%, respectively for detecting patients with definite (group 1) or likely (groups 3 and 4) ischaemic LVD.

Conclusion
Combined coronary and DE-MDCT can accurately differentiate ischaemic vs. non-ischaemic etiology of LVD.},

Complete maps in 17 patients demonstrated macroreentrant circuits (n=15) with 1 to 3 loops rotating around the mitral annulus, the pulmonary veins, and a zone of block or a silent area. In 2 patients, a small reentry circuit with a zone of markedly slow conduction was identified.

	abstract = {Atrial Fibrillation and WPW Syndrome.Introduction: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. To elucidate the mechanisms for PAF, we performed electrophysiologic studies (EPS) before and after ablation of accessory pathways (APs). Methods and Results: We investigated 24 patients with WPW syndrome who had AV reciprocating tachycardia and prior PAF and had undergone successful ablation of APs. Patients in whom atrial fibrillation (AF) was induced by EPS at day 7 after ablation were considered the inducible AF group (n = 14), and patients in whom AF was not induced by EPS at day 7 after ablation were considered the noninducible AF group (n = 10). Fifteen patients with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but without PAF who underwent ablation of the slow AV nodal pathways served as the control group (AVNRT group). Maximal atrial conduction delay and conduction delay zone, which are indices of atrial vulnerability, were measured before and after ablation. Before ablation, maximal atrial conduction delay and conduction delay zone were significantly greater (P {\textless} 0.0001 and P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively) in the two WPW syndrome groups than in the AVNRT group, indicating increased atrial vulnerability in WPW syndrome with PAF. After ablation, these parameters did not change in the inducible AF group, whereas they were significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) decreased in the noninducible AF group and were not different from those in the AVNRT group, indicating normalized atrial vulnerability in the noninducible AF group after ablation. The prospective study demonstrated that PAF recurred only in the inducible AF group during long-term follow-up (17 {\textpm} 7 months). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that there are two mechanisms of PAF in patients with WPW syndrome: one mechanism is reversible and AP-dependent atrial vulnerability, and the other is intrinsic and AP-independent atrial vulnerability.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An interventional system for minimally invasive cardiac surgery was developed for therapy delivery inside the beating heart, in absence of direct vision. METHOD: A system was developed to provide a virtual reality (VR) environment that integrates pre-operative imaging, real-time intra-operative guidance using 2D trans-esophageal ultrasound, and models of the surgical tools tracked using a magnetic tracking system. Detailed 3D dynamic cardiac models were synthesized from high-resolution pre-operative MR data and registered within the intra-operative imaging environment. The feature-based registration technique was employed to fuse pre- and intra-operative data during in vivo intracardiac procedures on porcine subjects. RESULTS: This method was found to be suitable for in vivo applications as it relies on easily identifiable landmarks, and hence, it ensures satisfactory alignment of pre- and intra-operative anatomy in the region of interest (4.8 mm RMS alignment accuracy) within the VR environment. Our initial experience in translating this work to guide intracardiac interventions, such as mitral valve implantation and atrial septal defect repair demonstrated feasibility of the methods. CONCLUSION: Surgical guidance in the absence of direct vision and with no exposure to ionizing radiation was achieved, so our virtual environment constitutes a feasible candidate for performing various off-pump intracardiac interventions.},

	abstract = {Objective
The Cox maze procedure was introduced in 1987 for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. This study evaluated the predictors of late atrial fibrillation recurrence in 276 consecutive patients who underwent this procedure at our institution.
Methods
From 1987 through June 2003, 276 patients (79 female and 197 male patients; mean age, 55 {\textpm} 11 years) underwent the Cox maze procedure. Thirty-three patients had Cox maze procedure I, 16 patients had Cox maze procedure II, and 197 patients had Cox maze procedure III. The last 30 patients underwent a modified procedure (Cox maze procedure IV) with bipolar radiofrequency ablation. There were 113 (41\%) patients who had a concomitant operation, most commonly either a mitral valve procedure (19\%) or coronary artery bypass grafting (20\%). Data were analyzed by means of univariate analysis, with preoperative and perioperative variables used as covariates. Patient follow-up was conducted by means of questionnaire, physician examination, and electrocardiographic documentation. All patients had a minimum of 6 months of follow-up.
Results
Patient follow-up was achieved in 92.8\% of cases, with a mean follow-up time of 5.8 {\textpm} 3.6 years. Risk factors for late atrial fibrillation recurrence were duration of preoperative atrial fibrillation (P = .01) and Cox maze procedure version (P = .001). There was no difference in actuarial 10-year survival between the Cox maze procedure versions.
Conclusion
The Cox maze procedure remains the gold standard for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and has excellent long-term efficacy. The most significant predictor of late recurrence was duration of preoperative atrial fibrillation, suggesting that earlier surgical intervention would further increase efficacy.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to show segmentation of the heart muscle in pediatric echocardiographic images as a preprocessing step for tissue analysis. Transthoracic image sequences (2-D and 3-D volume data, both derived in radiofrequency format, directly after beam forming) were registered in real time from four healthy children over three heart cycles. Three preprocessing methods, based on adaptive filtering, were used to reduce the speckle noise for optimizing the distinction between blood and myocardium, while preserving the sharpness of edges between anatomical structures. The filtering kernel size was linked to the local speckle size and the speckle noise characteristics were considered to define the optimal filter in one of the methods. The filtered 2-D images were thresholded automatically as a first step of segmentation of the endocardial wall. The final segmentation step was achieved by applying a deformable contour algorithm. This segmentation of each 2-D image of the 3-D + time (i.e., 4-D) datasets was related to that of the neighboring images in both time and space. By thus incorporating spatial and temporal information of 3-D ultrasound image sequences, an automated method using image statistics was developed to perform 3-D segmentation of the heart muscle.

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash}Dabigatran 150 and 110 mg twice a day and warfarin are effective for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this study was to compare their risks of bleeding in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY) trial.
Methods and Results{\textemdash}The RE-LY trial randomized 18 113 patients to receive dabigatran 110 or 150 mg twice a day or warfarin dose adjusted to an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 for a median follow-up of 2.0 years. Compared with warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg twice a day was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (2.87\% versus 3.57\%; P=0.002), whereas dabigatran 150 mg twice a day was associated with a similar risk of major bleeding (3.31\% versus 3.57\%; P=0.32). There was a significant treatment-by-age interaction, such that dabigatran 110 mg twice a day compared with warfarin was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding in patients aged {\textless}75 years (1.89\% versus 3.04\%; P{\textless}0.001) and a similar risk in those aged >=75 years (4.43\% versus 4.37\%; P=0.89; P for interaction {\textless}0.001), whereas dabigatran 150 mg twice a day compared with warfarin was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding in those aged {\textless}75 years (2.12\% versus 3.04\%; P{\textless}0.001) and a trend toward higher risk of major bleeding in those aged >=75 years (5.10\% versus 4.37\%; P=0.07; P for interaction {\textless}0.001). The interaction with age was evident for extracranial bleeding, but not for intracranial bleeding, with the risk of the latter being consistently reduced with dabigatran compared with warfarin irrespective of age.
Conclusions{\textemdash}In patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke, both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin have lower risks of both intracranial and extracranial bleeding in patients aged {\textless}75 years. In those aged >=75 years, intracranial bleeding risk is lower but extracranial bleeding risk is similar or higher with both doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin.

	abstract = {Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common, sustained rhythm disturbance. The prevalence of AF is increasing as people live longer. Common conditions such as hypertension and ischaemic heart disease play an important role in the development of AF. The presence of AF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from stroke and heart failure, particularly in patients with structural heart disease.
Sources of data This article provides evidence-based information on the key aspects of managing AF which is based on major guidelines, landmark clinical trials and meta-analyses.
Areas of agreement It is well recognized that both rate control and rhythm control are important strategies for the management of AF, but each approach should be chosen according to individual patient circumstances. A vast majority of elderly, relatively asymptomatic patients will benefit from ventricular rate control. Embolic stroke remains a major complication of AF. Yet, anticoagulation with warfarin remains underprescribed, especially in the elderly due to the presumed risk of bleeding. The technique of catheter ablation continues to improve and is generally successful in younger patients with relatively normal hearts.
Areas of controversy There are clinically relevant differences among published schemes designed to stratify stroke risk in patients with AF. The CHADS2 score is currently the most simple system to give some initial estimate of stroke risk in AF patients, but could significantly underestimate this risk, particularly in those who fall in the {\textquoteleft}intermediate{\textquoteright} risk category.
Growing points and areas timely for developing research Novel antiarrhythmic agents, including atrial specific agents with improved efficacy and safety profile, are currently under development. New antithrombotic agents with efficacy similar to warfarin which do not require regular INR testing appear to be promising, but there are lack of data about their long-term safety. There is increasing evidence that inflammation and fibrosis may play a major role in the initiation and maintenance of AF. Statins by means of their pleotropic effects and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers by preventing atrial remodelling may prove useful in preventing the development of AF. However, there is insufficient evidence to expand the use of these agents to a wider patient population at risk of AF. It needs to be seen if strategies towards primary and secondary prevention with treatment of underlying heart disease and modification of risk factors have a larger effect than specific interventions in preventing the burden of AF in the general population.},

	doi = {10.1161/CIRCEP.109.889311},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in contrast-enhanced multidetector CT enable detailed characterization of the left ventricular myocardium. Myocardial scar and border zone (BZ), as the target of ventricular tachycardia ablations, displays abnormal anatomic, dynamic, and perfusion characteristics during first-pass CT. This study assessed how contrast-enhanced CT can predict voltage-defined scar and BZ and integrate its scar reconstructions into clinical mapping systems to guide ventricular tachycardia ablations.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy underwent contrast-enhanced CT before ventricular tachycardia ablation. Segmental anatomic (end-systolic and end-diastolic wall thickness), dynamic (wall thickening, wall motion), and perfusion (hypoenhancement) characteristics were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic curves assessed the ability of CT to determine voltage-defined scar and BZ segments. Three-dimensional epi- and endocardial surfaces and scar borders were reconstructed, coregistered, and compared to voltages using a 17-segment model. Abnormal anatomic, dynamic, and perfusion data correlated well with abnormal ({\textless}1.5 mV) endocardial voltages (r=0.77). Three-dimensional reconstruction integrated into the clinical mapping system (registration accuracy, 3.31{\textpm}0.52 mm) allowed prediction of homogenous abnormal voltage ({\textless}1.5 mV) in 81.7\% of analyzed segments and correctly displayed transmural extent and intramural scar location. CT hypoperfusion correlated best with scar and BZ areas and encompassed curative ablations in 82\% cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic, dynamic, and perfusion imaging using contrast-enhanced CT allows characterization of left ventricular anatomy and 3D scar and BZ substrate. Integration of reconstructed 3D data sets into clinical mapping systems supplements information of voltage mapping and may enable new image approaches for substrate-guided ventricular tachycardia ablation.},

The WATCHMAN device (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) has the~most supportive data and is under evaluation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for warfarin-eligible patients. The Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (St. Jude Medical, Plymouth, Minnesota) has a large real-world experience over the past 5 years, and a randomized trial comparing Amplatzer Cardiac Plug with the WATCHMAN device is anticipated in the near future. The Lariat procedure (SentreHEART Inc., Redwood City, California) has also gained interest lately, but early studies were concerning for high rates of serious pericardial effusion and major bleeding. The current real-world experience predominantly involves patients who are not long-term anticoagulation candidates or who are perceived to have high bleeding risks. This pattern of practice is expected to change when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves the WATCHMAN device for warfarin-eligible patients.

This novel data structure combines the best features of the DT-Grid (of Nielsen and Museth [2004]) and the RLE Sparse Level Set (of Houston et al. [2004]) to provide both optimal efficiency and extreme versatility. In brief, the H-RLE level set employs an RLE in a dimensionally recursive fashion. The RLE scheme allows the compact storage of sequential nonnarrowband regions while the dimensionally recursive encoding along each axis efficiently compacts nonnarrowband planes and volumes. Consequently, this new structure can store and process level sets with effective voxel resolutions exceeding 5000 {\texttimes} 3000 {\texttimes} 3000 (45 billion voxels) on commodity PCs with only 1 GB of memory. This article, besides introducing the H-RLE level set data structure and its efficient core algorithms, also describes numerous applications that have benefited from our use of this structure: our unified implicit object representation, efficient and robust mesh to level set conversion, rapid ray tracing, level set metamorphosis, collision detection, and fully sparse fluid simulation (including RLE vector and matrix representations.) Our comparisons of the popular octree level set and Peng level set structures to the H-RLE level set indicate that the latter is superior in both narrowband sequential access speed and overall memory usage.},

We hypothesized that late gadolinium enhancement MRI (LGE-MRI) can identify left atrial (LA) wall structural remodeling (SRM) and stratify patients who are likely or not to benefit from ablation therapy.
Methods and Results{\textemdash}LGE-MRI was performed on 426 consecutive patients with AF without contraindications to MRI before undergoing their first ablation procedure and on 21 non-AF control subjects. Patients were categorized by SRM stage (I{\textendash}IV) based on the percentage of LA wall enhancement for correlation with procedure outcomes. Histological validation of SRM was performed comparing LGE-MRI with surgical biopsy. A total of 386 patients (91\%) with adequate LGE-MRI scans were included in the study. After ablation, 123 patients (31.9\%) experienced recurrent atrial arrhythmias during the 1-year follow-up. Recurrent arrhythmias (failed ablations) occurred at higher SRM stages with 28 of 133 (21.0\%) in stage I, 40 of 140 (29.3\%) in stage II, 24 of 71 (33.8\%) in stage III, and 30 of 42 (71.4\%) in stage IV. In multivariate analysis, ablation outcome was best predicted by advanced SRM stage (hazard ratio, 4.89; P{\textless}0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio, 1.64; P=0.036), whereas increased LA volume and persistent AF were not significant predictors. LA wall enhancement was significantly greater in patients with AF versus non-AF controls (16.6{\textpm}11.2\% versus 3.1{\textpm}1.9\%; P{\textless}0.0001). Histological evidence of remodeling from surgical biopsy specimens correlated with SRM on LGE-MRI.

After three interviews, 70\% of participants were classified as having false memories of committing a crime (theft, assault, or assault with a weapon) that led to police contact in early adolescence and volunteered a detailed false account. These reported false memories of crime were similar to false memories of noncriminal events and to true memory accounts, having the same kinds of complex descriptive and multisensory components.

One part of the model minimizes a shape related energy and the energy of geometric active contour with a parameter that balances the influence from these two. The minimizer corresponding to a fixed parameter in this minimization gives a segmentation and an alignment between the segmentation and prior shape. The second part of this model optimizes the selection of the parameter by maximizing the mutual information of image geometry between the prior and the aligned novel image over all the alignments corresponding to different parameters in the first part. By this coupling the segmentation arrives at higher image gradient, forms a shape similar to the prior, and captures the prior intensity profile. We also propose using mutual information of image geometry to generate intensity model from a set of training images. Experimental results on cardiac ultrasound images are presented. These results indicate that the proposed model provides close agreement with expert traced borders, and the parameter determined in this model for one image can be used for images with similar properties.},

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of `shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces},

The approach, which has not been used previously, can be divided into two distinct stages: feature extraction (edge detection, surface extraction), and geometric matching. Two kinds of corresponding features {\textemdash} edge and surface {\textemdash} are extracted hierarchically from various image modalities. The registration then is performed using least-squares matching of the automatically extracted features. Both the robustness and accuracy of feature extraction and geometric matching steps are evaluated using simulated and patient images. The preliminary results show the error is on the average of one voxel. We have shown the proposed 3D registration algorithm provides a simple and fast method for automatic registering of MR-to-CT and MR-to-PET image modalities. Our results are comparable to other techniques and require no user interaction.},

Intracardiac echocardiography allows real-time visualisation of the left atrium and adjacent structures and thus facilitates precise guidance of catheter-based ablation of atrial fibrillation. In patients with abnormal anatomy of the atria and/or the interatrial septum, intracardiac ultrasound might be especially valuable to guide transseptal access. Software algorithms like CARTOSound (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, USA) offer the opportunity to reconstruct multiple two-dimensional ultrasound fans generated by intracardiac echocardiography to a three-dimensional object which can be merged to a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging reconstruction of the left atrium. Intracardiac ultrasound reduces dwell time of catheters in the left atrium, fluoroscopy, and procedural time and is invaluable concerning early identification of potential adverse events. The application of intracardiac echocardiography has the great capability to improve success rates of catheter-based ablation procedures.},

Patients were selected who initially had normal atrial sizes and who had no evidence of significant structural or functional cardiac abnormalities other than atrial fibrillation either by history or two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography. Fifteen patients were studied (12 men and three women; mean age, 67.3 years). Average time between studies was 20.6 months. Three orthogonal left atrial dimensions and two right atrial dimensions were measured, and all were found to increase significantly between studies. Also, highly significant increases in calculated left atrial volume (from 45.2 to 64.1 cm3, p less than 0.001) and right atrial volume (from 49.2 to 66.2 cm3, p less than 0.001) were observed. The relative extents of left and right atrial volume increase did not differ, and left ventricular size did not change significantly between studies.

We are currently engaged in a project designed to replace many bypass surgeries with less traumatic, minimally invasive intracardiac therapies. This project combines real-time intra-operative echocardiography with a virtual reality environment providing the surgeon with a broad range of valuable information. Pre-operative images, electrophysiological data, positions of magnetically tracked surgical instruments, and dynamic surgical target representations are among the data that can be presented to the surgeon to augment intra-operative ultrasound images. This augmented reality system is applicable to procedures such as mitral valve replacement and atrial septal defect repair, as well as ablation therapies for treatment of atrial fibrillation. Our goal is to develop a robust augmented reality system that will improve the efficacy of intracardiac treatments and broaden the range of cardiac surgeries that can be performed in a minimally invasive manner.

	abstract = {Purpose Integration of a 3D reconstruction of the left atrium into cardiac mapping systems can aid catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). The two most widely used systems are NavX Fusion and Cartomerge. We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of these systems in a randomised trial. Methods Patients undergoing their first ablation were randomised to mapping using either NavX fusion or CartoMerge. Pulmonary vein isolation by wide area circumferential ablation was performed for paroxysmal AF with additional linear and fractionated potential ablation for persistent AF. Seven-day Holter monitoring was used for confirmation of sinus rhythm maintenance at 6 months. Results Ninety-seven patients were randomised and underwent a procedure. There was no difference in the primary endpoint of freedom from arrhythmia at 6 months (51\% in the Cartomerge group vs. 48\% in the NavX Fusion group, p = 0.76). 3D image registration was faster with Cartomerge (24 vs. 33 min, p = 0.0001), used less fluoroscopic screening (11 vs. 15 min, p = 0.039) with a lower fluoroscopic dose (840 vs. 1,415 mGyCm2, p = 0.043). There was a strong trend to lower ablation times in the Cartomerge group, overall RF time (3,292 s vs. 4,041, p = 0.07). Distance from 3D lesion to 3D image shell was smaller in the Cartomerge group (2.7 {\textpm} 1.9 vs. 3.3 {\textpm} 3.7 mm, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions Cartomerge appears to be faster and uses less fluoroscopy to achieve registration than NavX Fusion, but overall procedural times and clinical outcomes are similar.},

In cryptogenic stroke, migraine, and orthodeoxia/platypnea, a plausible biologic mechanism exists to support PFO closure as a possible treatment. Although transcatheter closure of PFO has been available for over 2 decades, it has remained controversial due to a paucity of evidence to guide patient and device selection. Contemporary studies investigating PFO closure as treatment for patients with these conditions have been published recently and longitudinal data regarding the safety and efficacy of the devices is now available. In this review, we aim to describe the potential clinical significance of a patent foramen in the adult, appraise the newest additions to the body of evidence, and discuss the safety, benefit, patient selection, and future of transcatheter treatment of PFO.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a previously developed segmentation algorithm was improved by adding a fully automated definition of a region of interest around the left ventricle. The method, dedicated to cine images, proceeds in two major steps. First, heart localization was achieved by exploiting the heart's beating motion. Then, a region of interest was created around the left ventricle by exploiting its circularity. Segmentation of the left ventricle was also performed with the previously proposed approach. The algorithm was tested on the cine MR images of the 2009 MICCAI Challenge database, including 45 subjects. The regions of interest and resulting segmentation were visually graded slice by slice. Heart localization was successful in all cases, and the restricted region of interest was acceptable in 2/3 of all cases. Finally the segmentation using the fully automated approach was satisfying for about 50\% of the slices.},

	abstract = {Background 
Three-dimensional virtual anatomic navigation is increasingly used during mapping and ablation of complex arrhythmias. NavX Fusion software aims to mold the virtual anatomy to the patient{\textquoteright}s computed tomography (CT) image; however, the accuracy and clinical usefulness of this system have not been reported. 
Objective 
The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy and describe the initial experience of CT image integration using NavX Fusion for atrial fibrillation ablation. 
Methods 
This study consisted of 55 consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation using NavX Fusion navigation. Left atrial NavX geometries were compared to a corresponding CT for geometric match. Geometric match, expressed as the difference in millimeters between CT and NavX geometry, was calculated for the original geometry (GEO-1), field scaled and primary fused geometry (GEO-2), and final secondary fused geometry (GEO-3). Navigational accuracy was assessed by moving the catheter to 10 discrete anatomic sites and determining the distance between the catheter tip and the closest GEO-2, GEO-3, and CT surface. Fusion integration time and procedural and fluoroscopic durations were recorded to assess clinical usefulness. 
Results 
GEO-1, GEO-2 and GEO-3 were associated with CT{\textendash}GEO errors of 6.6 {\textpm} 2.8 mm, 4.1 {\textpm} 0.7 mm, 1.9 {\textpm} 0.4 mm, respectively. Navigational accuracy was not significantly different for GEO-2, GEO-3, and CT at 3.4 {\textpm} 1.6 mm to any surface. A significant (P <=.001) inverse curvilinear relationship was present between case number and the time required for image integration (r2 = 0.35) and the fluoroscopic time normalized for procedural duration (r2 = 0.18). 
Conclusion 
Image integration using the NavX Fusion software is highly accurate and is associated with a progressive reduction in fluoroscopic time relative to procedural duration.},

	abstract = {Active contours are image segmentation methods that minimize the total energy of the contour to be segmented. Among the active contour methods, the radial methods have lower computational complexity and can be applied in real time. This work aims to present a new radial active contour technique, called pSnakes, using the 1D Hilbert transform as external energy. The pSnakes method is based on the fact that the beams in ultrasound equipment diverge from a single point of the probe, thus enabling the use of polar coordinates in the segmentation. The control points or nodes of the active contour are obtained in pairs and are called twin nodes. The internal energies as well as the external one, Hilbertian energy, are redefined. The results showed that pSnakes can be used in image segmentation of short-axis echocardiogram images and that they were effective in image segmentation of the left ventricle. The echo-cardiologist's golden standard showed that the pSnakes was the best method when compared with other methods. The main contributions of this work are the use of pSnakes and Hilbertian energy, as the external energy, in image segmentation. The Hilbertian energy is calculated by the 1D Hilbert transform. Compared with traditional methods, the pSnakes method is more suitable for ultrasound images because it is not affected by variations in image contrast, such as noise. The experimental results obtained by the left ventricle segmentation of echocardiographic images demonstrated the advantages of the proposed model. The results presented in this paper are justified due to an improved performance of the Hilbert energy in the presence of speckle noise.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, embolic stroke is thought to be associated with left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi. We assessed the efficacy and safety of percutaneous closure of the LAA for prevention of stroke compared with warfarin treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation.
Methods
Adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation were eligible for inclusion in this multicentre, randomised non-inferiority trial if they had at least one of the following: previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, or were 75 years or older. 707 eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio by computer-generated randomisation sequence to percutaneous closure of the LAA and subsequent discontinuation of warfarin (intervention; n=463) or to warfarin treatment with a target international normalised ratio between 2{\textperiodcentered}0 and 3{\textperiodcentered}0 (control; n=244). Efficacy was assessed by a primary composite endpoint of stroke, cardiovascular death, and systemic embolism. We selected a one-sided probability criterion of non-inferiority for the intervention of at least 97{\textperiodcentered}5\%, by use of a two-fold non-inferiority margin. Serious adverse events that constituted the primary endpoint for safety included major bleeding, pericardial effusion, and device embolisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00129545.
Findings
At 1065 patient-years of follow-up, the primary efficacy event rate was 3{\textperiodcentered}0 per 100 patient-years (95\% credible interval [CrI] 1{\textperiodcentered}9{\textendash}4{\textperiodcentered}5) in the intervention group and 4{\textperiodcentered}9 per 100 patient-years (2{\textperiodcentered}8{\textendash}7{\textperiodcentered}1) in the control group (rate ratio [RR] 0{\textperiodcentered}62, 95\% CrI 0{\textperiodcentered}35{\textendash}1{\textperiodcentered}25). The probability of non-inferiority of the intervention was more than 99{\textperiodcentered}9\%. Primary safety events were more frequent in the intervention group than in the control group (7{\textperiodcentered}4 per 100 patient-years, 95\% CrI 5{\textperiodcentered}5{\textendash}9{\textperiodcentered}7, vs 4{\textperiodcentered}4 per 100 patient-years, 95\% CrI 2{\textperiodcentered}5{\textendash}6{\textperiodcentered}7; RR 1{\textperiodcentered}69, 1{\textperiodcentered}01{\textendash}3{\textperiodcentered}19).
Interpretation
The efficacy of percutaneous closure of the LAA with this device was non-inferior to that of warfarin therapy. Although there was a higher rate of adverse safety events in the intervention group than in the control group, events in the intervention group were mainly a result of periprocedural complications. Closure of the LAA might provide an alternative strategy to chronic warfarin therapy for stroke prophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

	abstract = {Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may be extremely disabled despite medical therapy. Based on recent concepts of atrial fibrillation, a surgical open heart procedure was designed to isolate a "corridor" from the right and the left atrium. The corridor consists of the sinus node area, the atrioventricular nodal junction, and the connecting right atrial mass, small enough to prevent atrial fibrillation. Between 1987 and 1990, 20 patients with severely disabling symptoms due to frequent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation underwent the corridor operation, with permanent success in 16 patients. In 8 patients, left atrium to corridor conduction reappeared shortly after the procedure. Reoperation was performed in these patients without extracorporeal circulation. The site of persistent conduction between the left atrium and the corridor could consistently be localized adjacent to the coronary sinus. Nevertheless, reoperation failed to isolate permanently the corridor in 4 patients. During a mean follow-up of 20 months, atrial fibrillation dominating the ventricles was never observed nor inducible in the corridor in the 16 patients with a successful operation. In all cured patients, sinus node function remained undisturbed. Paroxysmal atrial flutter inside the corridor arose in 1 patient and a paroxysmal focal tachycardia in another. All 16 cured patients experienced a clear improvement in quality of life. Refinement of the surgical technique to obtain persistent isolation between the left atrium and the corridor is needed. These results demonstrate that the concept of the corridor operation is sound and justify its use in the treatment of drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.},

We sought to define the characteristics of native versus ablation-induced LA scar on late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Methods: LGE-MRI was performed before and at least 3 months after initial pulmonary vein antral isolation in 9 patients. The intra-cardiac locations of ablation points on electro-anatomic mapping were co-registered using custom software with the corresponding sites on the axial planes of post-procedural LGE-MRI. The image intensity ratio (IIR) defined as LA myocardial MRI signal intensity divided by the mean LA blood pool intensity was calculated for native scar on pre-procedural images and ablation-induced scar sites on post-procedural images.
Results: Pre- and post-procedural LGE-MRI planes were successfully co-registered with electro-anatomic map data in all cases. IIR values of 2988 ablation-induced scar sites and 1196 native scar sites collected from all patients were calculated. The mean IIR of ablation-induced scar sites on post-procedural images was 14.3\% higher than that of native scar sites on the pre-procedural MRI (1.28+/-0.26 vs. 1.12+/-0.11 p{\textless}0.001).
Conclusion: Ablation-induced scar has higher intensity than native scar on LGE-MRI suggesting greater uptake and/or reduced washout of gadolinium compared to regions with native scar.},

Methods and Results{\textemdash}Electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE for English scientific literature up to the 18th June 2012. A total of 2065 references were retrieved and evaluated for relevance. Reference lists of retrieved studies and review articles were examined to ensure all relevant studies were included. Data were extracted from 192 studies, total of 83 236 patients. The incidence of periprocedural complications for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation was 2.9\% (95\% confidence interval, 2.6{\textendash}3.2). There was a significant decrease in the acute complication rate in 2007 to 2012 compared with 2000 to 2006 (2.6\% versus 4.0\%; P=0.003). The complication rates reported were higher in prospective studies compared with those that retrospectively described complications (3.5\% versus 2.7\%; P=0.03). There were no significant associations among procedure duration, ablation time or ablation strategy, and acute complication rate.
Conclusions{\textemdash}Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation has a low incidence of periprocedural complications. The acute complication rate has decreased significantly in recent years. This may reflect improved catheter technology and experience. The use of different strategies across centers worldwide seems to be safe with no established relationship between procedural variables and complication rate.},

For instance, in the case of climate change, Republicans (conservatives) are especially skeptical of the relevant science, particularly when they are compared with Democrats (liberals). What causes such radical group differences? We suggest, as have previous accounts, that this phenomenon is often motivated. However, the source of this motivation is not necessarily an aversion to the problem, per se, but an aversion to the solutions associated with the problem. This difference in underlying process holds important implications for understanding, predicting, and influencing motivated skepticism. In 4 studies, we tested this solution aversion explanation for why people are often so divided over evidence and why this divide often occurs so saliently across political party lines. Studies 1, 2, and 3-using correlational and experimental methodologies-demonstrated that Republicans' increased skepticism toward environmental sciences may be partly attributable to a conflict between specific ideological values and the most popularly discussed environmental solutions. Study 4 found that, in a different domain (crime), those holding a more liberal ideology (support for gun control) also show skepticism motivated by solution aversion., (C) 2014 by the American Psychological Association},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In some highly trained athletes, the thickness of the left ventricular wall may increase as a consequence of exercise training and resemble that found in cardiac diseases associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In these athletes, the differential diagnosis between physiologic and pathologic hypertrophy may be difficult.
METHODS: To address this issue, we measured left ventricular dimensions with echocardiography in 947 elite, highly trained athletes who participated in a wide variety of sports.
RESULTS: The thickest left ventricular wall among the athletes measured 16 mm. Wall thicknesses within a range compatible with the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (greater than or equal to 13 mm) were identified in only 16 of the 947 athletes (1.7 percent); 15 were rowers or canoeists, and 1 was a cyclist. Therefore, the wall was greater than or equal to 13 mm thick in 7 percent of 219 rowers, canoeists, and cyclists but in none of 728 participants in 22 other sports. All athletes with walls greater than or equal to 13 mm thick also had enlarged left ventricular end-diastolic cavities (dimensions, 55 to 63 mm).
CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these data, a left-ventricular-wall thickness of greater than or equal to 13 mm is very uncommon in highly trained athletes, virtually confined to athletes training in rowing sports, and associated with an enlarged left ventricular cavity. In addition, the upper limit to which the thickness of the left ventricular wall may be increased by athletic training appears to be 16 mm. Therefore, athletes with a wall thickness of more than 16 mm and a nondilated left ventricular cavity are likely to have primary forms of pathologic hypertrophy, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.},

However, it has been shown previously that ultrasound images respond well to local phase-based methods which are theoretically intensity-invariant and thus suitable for low-contrast nature of ultrasound images. We extend the local phase-based method of feature asymmetry measure computation to detect 3D features using the monogenic signal, which is an isotropic extension of the analytic signal to higher dimensional functions. The proposed method is applied to real-time 3D echocardiography images and the visual results for the endocardial and epicardial boundary detection are presented.},

Over the past decade, various advanced cardiac mapping systems have been developed to create detailed cardiac maps and assist physicians in diagnosis and therapy guidance. While these systems have increased the ability to study and treat cardiac arrhythmias, inherent limitations exist. The objective of this paper is to describe and evaluate a system that extends current approaches to cardiac mapping, to create a dynamic cardiac map, using patient-specific cardiac models. This paper details novel approaches to collecting a stream of electrophysiological cardiac data, registering the data with patient-specific dynamic cardiac models, and displaying the data directly on the dynamic model surface, giving a more accurate and comprehensive visualization environment when compared to current systems. To validate the system, a series of laboratory and in vivo experiments were conducted. In the laboratory studies, the system was used to test the user's ability to accurately locate a landmark in physical space, as well as their ability to accurately navigate to a virtual location. In the in vivo studies the overall system performance was compared to an existing electrophysiological recording system, where right atrial cardiac maps were created during sinus and paced cardiac rhythms. The results showed that the new dynamic cardiac mapping system was able to maintain high accuracy in locating physical and virtual landmarks, while being able to create a dynamic cardiac map displayed on a dynamic cardiac surface model.},

However, most of these high-risk patients will never develop potential fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, modalities that stratify patients according to their risk of sudden cardiac death are needed. The electrophysiology study has, for decades, been used to prognosticate on patients' risk of sudden cardiac death. Recent data from the Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT) and Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II (MADIT II) demonstrate that in patients with ischemic heart disease and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, an electrophysiology study can help identify patients who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death. However, in these patient populations, the prognostic ability of an electrophysiology study is only modest and the negative predictive value is poor. In the future, combining the results of noninvasive modalities with invasive electrophysiology testing may improve our prognostic ability. Furthermore, expanding the role of the electrophysiology study to include therapeutic ablations may alter a patient's future risk of sudden cardiac death.},

A change in the way symphony orchestras recruit musicians provides an unusual way to test for sex-biased hiring. To overcome possible biases in hiring, most orchestras revised their audition policies in the 1970s and 1980s. A major change involved the use of blind' auditions with a screen' to conceal the identity of the candidate from the jury. Female musicians in the top five symphony orchestras in the United States were less than 5\% of all players in 1970 but are 25\% today. We ask whether women were more likely to be advanced and/or hired with the use of blind' auditions. Using data from actual auditions in an individual fixed-effects framework, we find that the screen increases by 50\% the probability a woman will be advanced out of certain preliminary rounds. The screen also enhances, by severalfold, the likelihood a female contestant will be the winner in the final round. Using data on orchestra personnel, the switch to blind' auditions can explain between 30\% and 55\% of the increase in the proportion female among new hires and between 25\% and 46\% of the increase in the percentage female in the orchestras since 1970.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) by catheter ablation is a cornerstone treatment of paroxysmal AF. Low success rates are mainly due to reconnecting tissue. Local myocardial wall-thickness (WT) information is missing; lesion transmurality is impossible to estimate. WT information can be obtained from pencil beam high-resolution MRI, a time-consuming protocol. To reduce scan time, automatic selection of regions of interest is proposed. We developed a left atrial target probability model for paroxysmal AF ablation, based on intraprocedural ablation targeting data of fifteen patients, to support the selection of these regions. A common mesh serves as a reference for registration of the electroanatomical meshes and ablation targets using landmark registration and the Iterative Closest Points algorithm. This is followed by projection of the ablation targets onto the mean mesh model, closure of isolated ablation voids on the surface and Gaussian smoothing of the probability distribution. The final probability distribution clearly shows PVI contours as suggested in the consensus statement by European associations. The right inferior pulmonary vein (RIPV) shows a lower ablation probability, which may be due to limited maneuverability of the ablation catheter and the proximity of the RIPV ostium and the transseptal puncture, where the catheter enters the left atrium.},

	abstract = {Objectives
This study investigated the left atrial appendage (LAA) by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to categorize different LAA morphologies and to correlate the morphology with the history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA).
Background
LAA represents one of the major sources of cardiac thrombus formation responsible for TIA/stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
Methods
We studied 932 patients with drug-refractory AF who were planning to undergo catheter ablation. All patients underwent cardiac CT or MRI of the LAA and were screened for history of TIA/stroke. Four different morphologies were used to categorize LAA: Cactus, Chicken Wing, Windsock, and Cauliflower.
Results
CT scans of 499 patients and MRI scans of 433 patients were analyzed (age 59 {\textpm} 10 years, 79\% were male, and 14\% had CHADS2 [Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age \&gt;75, Diabetes mellitus, and prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack] score >=2). The distribution of different LAA morphologies was Cactus (278 [30\%]), Chicken Wing (451 [48\%]), Windsock (179 [19\%]), and Cauliflower (24 [3\%]). Of the 932 patients, 78 (8\%) had a history of ischemic stroke or TIA. The prevalence of pre-procedure stroke/TIA in Cactus, Chicken Wing, Windsock, and Cauliflower morphologies was 12\%, 4\%, 10\%, and 18\%, respectively (p = 0.003). After controlling for CHADS2 score, gender, and AF types in a multivariable logistic model, Chicken Wing morphology was found to be 79\% less likely to have a stroke/TIA history (odd ratio: 0.21, 95\% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.91, p = 0.036). In a separate multivariate model, we entered Chicken Wing as the reference group and assessed the likelihood of stroke in other groups in relation to reference. Compared with Chicken Wing, Cactus was 4.08 times (p = 0.046), Windsock was 4.5 times (p = 0.038), and Cauliflower was 8.0 times (p = 0.056) more likely to have had a stroke/TIA.
Conclusions
Patients with Chicken Wing LAA morphology are less likely to have an embolic event even after controlling for comorbidities and CHADS2 score. If confirmed, these results could have a relevant impact on the anticoagulation management of patients with a low-intermediate risk for stroke/TIA.},

Three-dimensional magnetic resonance scans were acquired on eight normal volunteers and ten patients. The volunteers were imaged at multiple positions in the breathing cycle between full exhalation and full inhalation while holding their breath. The exhalation volume was segmented and used as a template to which the other volumes were registered using an intensity-based rigid registration algorithm followed by nonrigid registration. The patients were imaged at inhale and exhale only. The registration results were validated by visual assessment and consistency measurements indicating subvoxel registration accuracy. For all subjects, we assessed the nonrigid motion of the heart at the right coronary artery, right atrium, and left ventricle. We show that the rigid-body motion of the heart is primarily in the craniocaudal direction with smaller displacements in the right-left and anterior-posterior directions; this is in agreement with previous studies. Deformation was greatest for the free wall of the right atrium and the left ventricle; typical deformations were 3-4 mm with deformations of up to 7 mm observed in some subjects. Using the registration results, landmarks on the template surface were mapped to their correct positions through the breathing cycle. Principal component analysis produced a statistical model of the motion and deformation of the heart. We discuss how this model could be used to assist motion correction.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Real-time cardiac ultrasound (US) allows monitoring the heart motion during intracardiac beating heart procedures. Our application assists pediatric atrial septal defect (ASD) closure techniques using real-time 3D US guidance and rigid instruments. ASD tracking is also an important tool for facilitating systematic clinical studies of the dynamic behavior of the intra-atrial communication. One major image processing challenge is associated with the required processing of information at high frame rate, especially given the low image quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present an optimization scheme for a block flow technique, which combines the probability-based velocity computation for an entire block (a 3D volume centered on the ASD) with cyclic template matching. The adapted similarity imposes constraints both locally (from frame to frame) to conserve energy, and globally (from a reference template) to minimize cumulative errors. The algorithm is optimized for fast and reliable results. For tests, we use three intra-operational 4D ultrasound sequences of clinical infant beating hearts with ASD. RESULTS: Computing velocity at the block level with an optimized scheme, our technique tracks ASD motion at a frequency of 60 frames/s on clinical 4D datasets. Results are stable and accurate for changes in resolution and block size. In particular, we show robust real-time tracking and preliminary segmentation results of the ASD shape, size and orientation as a function of time. CONCLUSIONS: We present an optimized block flow technique for real-time tracking of ASD to assist in minimally invasive beating heart surgery. Our method proposes the standard use of references for processing repetitive data. This paper represents, to our knowledge, the first study on the dynamic morphology of ASD that takes into account the angular effect introduced by the slanted position of the intra-atrial communication with respect to the US probe.},

All patients with clinically significant disease at angiography (defined as at least one stenosis with a diameter narrowing of at least 50\%) had some coronary artery calcification present at ultrafast CT (100\% sensitivity in this population). The absence of calcification at ultrafast CT had a 100\% negative predictive value for clinically significant coronary artery disease.

The speed may be an arbitrary function of curvature, and the front also can be passively advected by an underlying flow. These algorithms approximate the equations of motion, which resemble Hamilton-Jacobi equations with parabolic right-hand sides, by using techniques from hyperbolic conservation laws. Non-oscillatory schemes of various orders of accuracy are used to solve the equations, providing methods that accurately capture the formation of sharp gradients and cusps in the moving fronts. The algorithms handle topological merging and breaking naturally, work in any number of space dimensions, and do not require that the moving surface be written as a function. The methods can be also used for more general Hamilton-Jacobi-type problems. We demonstrate our algorithms by computing the solution to a variety of surface motion problems.},

	abstract = {Importance~
Left atrial fibrosis is prominent in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Extensive atrial tissue fibrosis identified by delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with poor outcomes of AF catheter ablation.Objective
To characterize the feasibility of atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI and its association with subsequent AF ablation outcome.Design, Setting, and Participants
Multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with paroxysmal and persistent AF (undergoing their first catheter ablation) conducted between August 2010 and August 2011 at 15 centers in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Delayed enhancement MRI images were obtained up to 30 days before ablation.Main Outcomes and Measures
Fibrosis quantification was performed at a core laboratory blinded to the participating center, ablation approach, and procedure outcome. Fibrosis blinded to the treating physicians was categorized as stage 1 ({\textless}10\% of the atrial wall), 2 (>=10\%-{\textless}20\%), 3 (>=20\%-{\textless}30\%), and 4 (>=30\%). Patients were followed up for recurrent arrhythmia per current guidelines using electrocardiography or ambulatory monitor recording and results were analyzed at a core laboratory. Cumulative incidence of recurrence was estimated by stage at days 325 and 475 after a 90-day blanking period (standard time allowed for arrhythmias related to ablation-induced inflammation to subside) and the risk of recurrence was estimated (adjusting for 10 demographic and clinical covariates).Results
Atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI was successfully quantified in 272 of 329 enrolled patients (57 patients [17\%] were excluded due to poor MRI quality). There were 260 patients who were followed up after the blanking period (mean [SD] age of 59.1 [10.7] years, 31.5\% female, 64.6\% with paroxysmal AF). For recurrent arrhythmia, the unadjusted overall hazard ratio per 1\% increase in left atrial fibrosis was 1.06 (95\% CI, 1.03-1.08; P {\textless} .001). Estimated unadjusted cumulative incidence of recurrent arrhythmia by day 325 for stage 1 fibrosis was 15.3\% (95\% CI, 7.6\%-29.6\%); stage 2, 32.6\% (95\% CI, 24.3\%-42.9\%); stage 3, 45.9\% (95\% CI, 35.5\%-57.5\%); and stage 4, 51.1\% (95\% CI, 32.8\%-72.2\%) and by day 475 was 15.3\% (95\% CI, 7.6\%-29.6\%), 35.8\% (95\% CI, 26.2\%-47.6\%), 45.9\% (95\% CI, 35.6\%-57.5\%), and 69.4\% (95\% CI, 48.6\%-87.7\%), respectively. Similar results were obtained after covariate adjustment. The addition of fibrosis to a recurrence prediction model that includes traditional clinical covariates resulted in an improved predictive accuracy with the C statistic increasing from 0.65 to 0.69 (risk difference of 0.05; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.09).Conclusions and Relevance
Among patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation, atrial tissue fibrosis estimated by delayed enhancement MRI was independently associated with likelihood of recurrent arrhythmia. The clinical implications of this association warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {Objectives 
The purpose of this study was to correlate infarct age with characteristics of the endocardial electrograms (EGM) obtained in patients undergoing mapping procedures for postinfarction ventricular tachycardia (VT). 
Background 
Experimental studies have demonstrated that infarct age influences EGM duration in the subepicardial left ventricle (LV). The relationship between infarct age and endocardial EGM characteristics has not been investigated in patients with postinfarction VT. 
Methods 
In a consecutive series of 23 patients with a history of remote infarction (range 1 to 31 years) and VT, endocardial LV mapping was performed with an electroanatomical mapping system (CARTO, Biosense Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, California) during sinus rhythm. Electrogram morphology and width were analyzed and correlated with infarct age. Isthmus sites of the VT re-entry circuits were identified by entrainment mapping and related to the results of substrate mapping. 
Results 
There was a significant correlation between infarct age and width of the bipolar endocardial EGM during baseline rhythm in the peri-infarct zone (r = 0.84; p \&lt; 0.0001). Increasing infarct age was associated with progressive activation delays in the scar and with isolated potentials separated by an isoelectric interval, the duration of which also correlated with infarct age (r = 0.77; p \&lt; 0.001). Among all endocardial sites, the VT isthmus sites displayed the most delay and broadest EGMs during sinus rhythm. 
Conclusions 
The presence of broad, fractionated EGMs and isolated potentials indicates a healed myocardial infarction; the older the infarction, the broader the EGM width. Remodeling over time alters the electrophysiologic properties of the peri-infarct tissue.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Intraoperative left atrial radiofrequency (RF) ablation recently has been suggested as an effective surgical treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of this study was to verify the outcome of this technique in a controlled multicenter trial. Methods and Results: One hundred three consecutive patients (39 men and 65 women; age 62 {\textpm} 11 years) affected by AF underwent cardiac surgery and RF ablation in the left atrium (RF group). The control group consisted of 27 patients (6 men and 21 women; age 64 {\textpm} 7 years) with AF who underwent cardiac surgery during the same period and refused RF ablation. Mitral valve disease was present in 89 (86\%) and 25 (92\%) patients, respectively (P = NS). RF endocardial ablation was performed in order to obtain isolation of both right and left pulmonary veins, a lesion connecting the previous lines, and a lesion connecting the line encircling the left veins to the mitral annulus. Upon discharge from the hospital, sinus rhythm was present in 65 patients (63\%) versus 5 patients (18\%) in the control group (P {\textless} 0.0001). Mean time of cardiopulmonary bypass was longer in the RF group (148 {\textpm} 50 min vs 117 {\textpm} 30 min, P = 0.013). The complication rate was similar in both groups, but RF ablation-related complications occurred in 4 RF group patients (3.9\%). After a mean follow-up of 12.5 {\textpm} 5 months (range 4{\textendash}24), 83 (81\%) of 102 RF group patients were in stable sinus rhythm versus 3 (11\%) of 27 in the control group (P {\textless} 0.0001). The success rate was similar among the four surgical centers. Atrial contraction was present in 66 (79.5\%) of 83 patients in the RF group in sinus rhythm. Conclusion: Endocardial RF left atrial compartmentalization during cardiac surgery is effective in restoring sinus rhythm in many patients. This technique is easy to perform and reproducible. Rare RF ablation-related complications can occur. During follow-up, sinus rhythm persistence is good, and biatrial contraction is preserved in most patients.

A map with negligible errors can be produced in two picture scans which has to include forward and backward movement for each line. Thus, for expanding/shrinking purposes it may compete very successfully with iterative parallel propagation in the binary picture itself. It is shown that skeletons can be produced by simple procedures and since these are based on Euclidean distances it is assumed that they are superior to skeletons based on d4-, d8-, and even octagonal metrics.},

	abstract = {National randomized experiments and validation studies were conducted on 873 tenure-track faculty (439 male, 434 female) from biology, engineering, economics, and psychology at 371 universities/colleges from 50 US states and the District of Columbia. In the main experiment, 363 faculty members evaluated narrative summaries describing hypothetical female and male applicants for tenure-track assistant professorships who shared the same lifestyle (e.g., single without children, married with children). Applicants' profiles were systematically varied to disguise identically rated scholarship; profiles were counterbalanced by gender across faculty to enable between-faculty comparisons of hiring preferences for identically qualified women versus men. Results revealed a 2:1 preference for women by faculty of both genders across both math-intensive and non{\textendash}math-intensive fields, with the single exception of male economists, who showed no gender preference. Results were replicated using weighted analyses to control for national sample characteristics. In follow-up experiments, 144 faculty evaluated competing applicants with differing lifestyles (e.g., divorced mother vs. married father), and 204 faculty compared same-gender candidates with children, but differing in whether they took 1-y-parental leaves in graduate school. Women preferred divorced mothers to married fathers; men preferred mothers who took leaves to mothers who did not. In two validation studies, 35 engineering faculty provided rankings using full curricula vitae instead of narratives, and 127 faculty rated one applicant rather than choosing from a mixed-gender group; the same preference for women was shown by faculty of both genders. These results suggest it is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science. Messages to the contrary may discourage women from applying for STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) tenure-track assistant professorships.},

	abstract = {Objectives 
We describe a noninvasive method of detecting and quantifying left atrial (LA) wall injury after pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Using a 3-dimensional (3D) delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence and novel processing methods, LA wall scarring is visualized at high resolution after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). 
Background 
Radiofrequency ablation to achieve PVAI is a promising approach to curing AF. Controlled lesion delivery and scar formation within the LA are indicators of procedural success, but the assessment of these factors is limited to invasive methods. Noninvasive evaluation of LA wall injury to assess permanent tissue injury may be an important step in improving procedural success. 
Methods 
Imaging of the LA wall with a 3D delayed-enhanced cardiac MRI sequence was performed before and 3 months after ablation in 46 patients undergoing PVAI for AF. Our 3D respiratory-navigated MRI sequence using parallel imaging resulted in 1.25 {\texttimes} 1.25 {\texttimes} 2.5 mm (reconstructed to 0.6 {\texttimes} 0.6 {\texttimes} 1.25 mm) spatial resolution with imaging times ranging 8 to 12 min. 
Results 
Radiofrequency ablation resulted in hyperenhancement of the LA wall in all patients post-PVAI and may represent tissue scarring. New methods of reconstructing the LA in 3D allowed quantification of LA scarring using automated methods. Arrhythmia recurrence at 3 months correlated with the degree of wall enhancement with \&gt;13\% injury predicting freedom from AF (odds ratio: 18.5, 95\% confidence interval: 1.27 to 268, p = 0.032). 
Conclusions 
We define noninvasive MRI methods that allow for the detection and quantification of LA wall scarring after RF ablation in patients with AF. Moreover, there seems to be a correlation between the extent of LA wall injury and short-term procedural outcome.},

	abstract = {Objective: Similar structural changes in the myocardium can be observed in chronic hibernating myocardium and in myocardium taken from hearts suffering chronic atrial fibrillation. We investigated whether or not these changes are indicative of apoptosis. Methods: Myocardial biopsies from 28 strictly selected patients with chronic hibernating myocardium and heart samples from 13 goats with pacing-induced chronic atrial fibrillation were used. Special attention was paid to processing the tissues immediately (fixation/freezing) in order to prevent artificial degenerative changes, thereby excluding false positive identification of apoptosis. Infarcted areas or infarcted border zones were excluded from our study. Apoptosis was detected with light and electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end-labelling. Immunohistochemistry was used for detecting Bcl-2, P53 and PCNA-proteins associated with apoptosis/DNA damage. Results: The results obtained for chronic hibernating left ventricular myocardium were similar to those for chronic fibrillating atrial myocardium. No apoptotic nuclei, as characterised by extensive chromatin clumping, could be observed in normal or dedifferentiated cardiomyocytes under the electron microscope. The end-labelling assay did not reveal any cardiomyocytes with damaged DNA. Nor could we find any evidence of substantial expression of Bcl-2, P53 or PCNA, a result indicative of the absence of apoptotic threat or DNA damage. Conclusion: Cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation, but not extensive degeneration through apoptosis, can be observed in chronic hibernating myocardium and chronic fibrillating atrium. Dedifferentiation may be the best way to survive prolonged exposure to the unfavourable conditions imposed by increased wall stress, a relative lowered oxygen environment, or both.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The purpose of this study was to critically appraise guidelines on imaging of asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).

Background
Various imaging tests exist to detect CAD in asymptomatic persons. Because randomized controlled trials are lacking, guidelines that address the use of CAD imaging tests may disagree.

Methods
Guidelines in English published between January 1, 2003, and February 26, 2010, were retrieved using MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, the National Library for Health, the Canadian Medication Association Infobase, and the Guidelines International Network International Guideline Library. Guidelines developed by national and international medical societies from Western countries, containing recommendations on imaging of asymptomatic CAD were included. Rigor of development was scored by 2 independent reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument. One reviewer performed full extraction of recommendations, which was checked by a second reviewer.

Results
Of 2,415 titles identified, 14 guidelines met our inclusion criteria. Eleven of 14 guidelines reported relationship with industry. The AGREE scores varied across guidelines from 21\% to 93\%. Two guidelines considered cost effectiveness. Eight guidelines recommended against or found insufficient evidence for testing of asymptomatic CAD. The other 6 guidelines recommended imaging patients at intermediate or high CAD risk based on the Framingham risk score, and 5 considered computed tomography calcium scoring useful for this purpose.

Conclusions
Guidelines on risk assessment by imaging of asymptomatic CAD contain conflicting recommendations. More research, including randomized controlled trials, evaluating the impact of imaging on clinical outcomes and costs is needed.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash} Electric isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) can successfully treat patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. However, it remains technically challenging to identify the left atrial{\textendash}PV junction and sequentially position the ablation catheter in a point-by-point contiguous fashion to isolate the PVs. In this study, a novel endoscopic ablation system was used to directly visualize and ablate tissue at the left atrial{\textendash}PV junction with laser energy.
Methods and Results{\textemdash} This study consisted of 2 phases: a short-term (n=9) and long-term (n=11) canine experimental validation phase and a multicenter clinical feasibility phase (n=30 paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients). After transseptal puncture, the balloon-based endoscopic ablation system was advanced to each PV ostium, and arcs of laser energy (90{\textdegree} to 360{\textdegree}) were projected onto the target left atrial{\textendash}PV junction. Electric PV isolation was defined with a circular multielectrode catheter. In the short-term preclinical experimental phase, 15 of 17 targeted PVs (88\%) were successfully isolated. Pathological examination revealed well-demarcated circumferential lesions with minimal endothelial disruption. In the long-term experiments, 9 of 10 targeted veins (90\%) remained persistently isolated (at 4 to 8 weeks). In the clinical phase, 105 of 116 PVs (91\%) were successfully isolated. After a single procedure, the 12-month drug-free rate of freedom from atrial fibrillation was 60\% (18 of 30 patients). There were no significant PV stenoses, but adverse events included 1 episode of cardiac tamponade, 1 stroke without residual defect, and 1 asymptomatic phrenic nerve palsy.
Conclusion{\textemdash} This study establishes the feasibility of a novel paradigm for AF ablation: direct visualization to guide catheter ablation of the left atrial{\textendash}PV junction.},

	abstract = {Background In this study we tested the hypothesis that atrial fibrillation (AF) causes electrophysiological changes of the atrial myocardium which might explain the progressive nature of the arrhythmia.
Methods and Results Twelve goats were chronically instrumented with multiple electrodes sutured to the epicardium of both atria. Two to 3 Weeks after implantation, the animals were connected to a fibrillation pacemaker which artificially maintained AF. Whereas during control episodes of AF were short lasting (6{\textpm}3 seconds), artificial maintenance of AF resulted in a progressive increase in the duration of AF to become sustained ({\textgreater}24 hours) after 7.1{\textpm}4.8 days (10 of 11 goats). During the first 24 hours of AF the median fibrillation interval shortened from 145{\textpm}18 to 108{\textpm}8 ms and the inducibility of AF by a single premature stimulus increased from 24\% to 76\%. The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) shortened from 146{\textpm}19 to 95{\textpm}20 ms (-35\%) (S1S1, 400 ms). At high pacing rates the shortening was less (-12\%), pointing to a reversion of the normal adaptation of the AERP to heart rate. In 5 goats, after 2 to 4 weeks of AF, sinus rhythm was restored and all electrophysiological changes were found to be reversible within 1 week.
Conclusions Artificial maintenance of AF leads to a marked shortening of AERP, a reversion of its physiological rate adaptation, and an increase in rate, inducibility and stability of AF. All these changes were completely reversible within 1 week of sinus rhythm.},

Methods and results A total of 202 patients received dabigatran as part of their periprocedural anticoagulation regimen at the time of initial or redo catheter ablation for symptomatic atrial fibrillation. A comparison group of 202 patients treated with warfarin was randomly selected from patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation during the same time period. AF types were paroxysmal in 223 patients, persistent in 158 patients, and longstanding persistent in 13 patients. Mean age was 60.0 {\textpm} 10.5 years, 55 \% had a history of hypertension, and mean CHADS-VASc score was 1.7 {\textpm} 1.3. {\textquotedblleft}Continuous{\textquotedblright} warfarin or dabigatran was administered in 80 and 32 \% of patients, respectively.

	abstract = {3D ultrasound imaging has enabled minimally invasive, beating heart intracardiac procedures. However, rapid heart motion poses a serious challenge to the surgeon that is compounded by significant time delays and noise in 3D ultrasound. This paper investigates the concept of using a one-degree-of-freedom motion compensation system to synchronize with tissue motions that may be approximated by 1D motion models. We characterize the motion of the mitral valve annulus and show that it is well approximated by a 1D model. The subsequent development of a motion compensation instrument (MCI) is described, as well as an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that compensates for system delays. The benefits and robustness of motion compensation are tested in user trials under a series of non-ideal tracking conditions. Results indicate that the MCI provides an approximately 50\% increase in dexterity and 50\% decrease in force when compared with a solid tool, but is sensitive to time delays. We demonstrate that the use of the EKF for delay compensation restores performance, even in situations of high heart rate variability. The resulting system is tested in an in vitro 3D ultrasound-guided servoing task, yielding accurate tracking (1.15 mm root mean square) in the presence of noisy, time-delayed 3D ultrasound measurements.},

	abstract = {The biodistribution of approved gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is reviewed. After intravenous injection GBCAs distribute in the blood and the extracellular space and transiently through the excretory organs. Preclinical animal studies and the available clinical literature indicate that all these compounds are excreted intact. Elimination tends to be rapid and, for the most part, complete. In renally insufficient patients the plasma elimination half-life increases substantially from hours to days depending on renal function. In patients with impaired renal function and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), the agents gadodiamide, gadoversetamide, and gadopentetate dimeglumine have been shown to result in Gd deposition in the skin and internal organs. In these cases, it is likely that the Gd is no longer present as the GBCA, but this has still not been definitively shown. In preclinical models very small amounts of Gd are retained in the bone and liver, and the amount retained correlates with the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the GBCA with respect to Gd release in vitro. The pattern of residual Gd deposition in NSF subjects may be different than that observed in preclinical rodent models. GBCAs are designed to be used via intravenous administration. Altering the route of administration and/or the formulation of the GBCA can dramatically alter the biodistribution of the GBCA and can increase the likelihood of Gd deposition. J. Magn. Reson.

Fast and automatic segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) is essential to enable an efficient quantitative analysis of these 3D data. Recently, we proposed a GPU implementation of the Level-Set (LS) Sparse Field algorithm for 3D image segmentation which combines high computational efficiency and flexibility in the interface evolution. In this work, we make our GPU LS solver able to deal with strongly inhomogeneous images such as the myocardial wall in RT3DE. The applicability of our method in clinical environment was evaluated by measuring LV volumetric parameters on 23 RT3DE exams, and comparing them with reference values from manual contouring. Results show the effectiveness of our framework in performing accurate LV myocardium segmentation in RT3DE near real-time.},

Transdermal patches and vaginal ring belong to high-risk products. The risk of thrombotic stroke and myocardial infarction is increased 50 {\textendash} 100\% with use of combined products, with little difference in risk between different progestins. Progestin-only products do not confer any increased risk of venous or arterial thrombosis, except for progestin depot, which may double the risk of venous thrombosis.Expert opinion: First choice in women below 35 years should be a combined low-risk pill, that is, with a second-generation progestin, with the lowest compliable dose of estrogen. Young women with risk factors of thrombosis such as age above 35 years, genetic predispositions, adiposity, polycystic ovary syndrome, diabetes, smoking, hypertension or migraine with aura should not use high-risk products, but should primarily consider progestin-only products, and be careful to use low-risk combined products.},

This shape knowledge is often learned via an off-line training process, which requires tedious human effort and is highly expertise-dependent. More importantly, a learned shape template can only be used to segment a specific class of images with similar boundary shape. In this paper, we present a multi-scale level set framework for segmentation of endocardial boundaries at each frame in a multiframe echocardiographic image sequence. We point out that the intensity distribution of an ultrasound image at a very coarse scale can be approximately modeled by Gaussian. Then we combine region homogeneity and edge features in a level set approach to extract boundaries automatically at this coarse scale. At finer scale levels, these coarse boundaries are used to both initialize boundary detection and serve as an external constraint to guide contour evolution. This constraint functions similar to a traditional shape prior. Experimental results validate this combinative framework.},

	abstract = {Background Ablation therapy for certain arrhythmias requires the formation of complex lesions based on electrical and anatomic mapping. We tested the accuracy and reproducibility of a nonfluoroscopic mapping and navigation (NFM) system to guide delivery of radiofrequency (RF) energy in the right atrium (RA) of swine.
Methods and Results The NFM system uses an ultralow magnetic field to measure the real-time three-dimensional (3D) location of the tip of the locatable catheter. While in stable contact with the endocardium, between 30 and 40 consecutive tip locations were sampled and used for the 3D reconstruction of the RA geometry. The location of the catheter tip was presented in real time, superimposed over the RA geometry. We selected a point on the 3D reconstruction and delivered RF energy to that site via the tip of the locatable catheter. The catheter was then completely withdrawn and renavigated twice to the same point, at which RF energy was delivered again. At autopsy, the distance between the centers of the three ablation points (mean{\textpm}SEM) was 2.3{\textpm}0.5 mm (n=27). Similarly, we used the NFM system to guide the generation of linear lesions. The measured length of the linear lesions on the NFM 3D view was close to the actual lesion length measured at autopsy (correlation coefficient, .96; P=.002; n=6). Furthermore, the location, shape, and continuity of the linear lesions corresponded to the autopsy findings.
Conclusions We conclude that the NFM system can guide the application of RF energy without the use of fluoroscopy in a highly accurate and reproducible manner.},

These changes are indicators of AF severity and appear to be predictors of treatment outcome. In this study, we report the utility of delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) in detecting abnormal atrial tissue before radiofrequency ablation and in predicting procedural outcome.
Methods and Results{\textemdash} Eighty-one patients presenting for pulmonary vein antrum isolation for treatment of AF underwent 3-dimensional DE-MRI of the left atrium before the ablation. Six healthy volunteers also were scanned. DE-MRI images were manually segmented to isolate the left atrium, and custom software was implemented to quantify the spatial extent of delayed enhancement, which was then compared with the regions of low voltage from electroanatomic maps from the pulmonary vein antrum isolation procedure. Patients were assessed for AF recurrence at least 6 months after pulmonary vein antrum isolation, with an average follow-up of 9.6{\textpm}3.7 months (range, 6 to 19 months). On the basis of the extent of preablation enhancement, 43 patients were classified as having minimal enhancement (average enhancement, 8.0{\textpm}4.2\%), 30 as having moderate enhancement (21.3{\textpm}5.8\%), and 8 as having extensive enhancement (50.1{\textpm}15.4\%). The rate of AF recurrence was 6 patients (14.0\%) with minimal enhancement, 13 (43.3\%) with moderate enhancement, and 6 (75\%) with extensive enhancement (P{\textless}0.001).
Conclusions{\textemdash} DE-MRI provides a noninvasive means of assessing left atrial myocardial tissue in patients suffering from AF and might provide insight into the progress of the disease.

Cardiac imaging at 3T, however, is both subtly and significantly different from imaging at 1.5T because of increased susceptibility artifacts, differences in tissue relaxation, and RF homogeneity issues. New RF excitation and pulse sequence designs are presented which deal with the fat-suppression requirements and off-resonance issues at 3T. Real-time cardiac imaging at 3T is demonstrated with high blood SNR, blood-myocardium CNR, resolution, and image quality, using new spectral-spatial RF pulses and fast spiral gradient echo pulse sequences. The proposed sequence achieves 1.5 mm in-plane resolution over a 20 cm FOV, with a 5.52 mm measured slice thickness and 32 dB of lipid suppression. Complete images are acquired every 120 ms and are reconstructed and displayed at 24 frames/sec using a sliding window. Results from healthy volunteers show improved image quality, a 53\% improvement in blood SNR efficiency, and a 232\% improvement in blood-myocardium CNR efficiency compared to 1.5T.

	abstract = {Objectives~
The goal of this study was to assess the impact of left atrial scarring (LAS) on the outcome of patients undergoing pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) for atrial fibrillation (AF).Background
Left atrial scarring may be responsible for both the perpetuation and genesis of AF.Methods
A total of 700 consecutive patients undergoing first-time PVAI were studied. Before ablation, extensive voltage mapping of the left atrium (LA) was performed using a multipolar Lasso catheter guided by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE). Patients with LAS were defined by a complete absence of electrographic recording by a circular mapping catheter in multiple LA locations, and this was validated by electroanatomic mapping. All four pulmonary vein antra and the superior vena cava were isolated using an ICE-guided technique. Patients were followed at least nine months for late AF recurrence. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the predictive value of LAS and other variables on outcome.Results
Of 700 patients, 42 had LAS, which represented 21 {\textpm} 11\% of the LA surface area by electroanatomic mapping. Patients with LAS had a significantly higher AF recurrence (57\%) compared with non-LAS patients (19\%, p = 0.003). Also, LAS was associated with a significantly larger LA size, lower ejection fraction, and higher C-reactive protein levels. Univariate analysis revealed age, nonparoxysmal AF, and LAS as predictors of recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed LAS as the only independent predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio 3.4, 95\% confidence interval 1.3 to 9.4; p = 0.01).Conclusions
Pre-existent LAS in patients undergoing PVAI for AF is a powerful, independent predictor of procedural failure. Left atrial scarring is associated with a lower EF, larger LA size, and increased inflammatory markers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Criteria have not been established for identifying LA scar using electroanatomic mapping (EAM). It is also unclear if voltage criteria using EAM may assist in identifying areas of pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection in patients undergoing repeat AF ablation.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize left atrial (LA) voltage in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation.
METHODS: An LA shell was created and bipolar voltage amplitude (in mV) at each point was measured. The shell was divided into 8 regions. Bipolar voltage values lower than the amplitude of 95\% of sampled points was used as the upper cutoff value. Delayed enhancement (DE) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) sequences were performed to validate voltage cutoffs.
RESULTS: Twenty patients participated. A mean of 141 {\textpm} 12 points constituted the LA map that was created during sinus rhythm (SR). In patients undergoing initial AF ablation, mean bipolar LA voltage was 1.44 {\textpm} 1.27 mV. In patients undergoing repeat AF ablation, scar along the posterior wall and LA-PV junction was identified using a voltage cutoff {\textless}0.2 mV, whereas a cutoff {\textless}0.45 mV best identified scar at other locations. This voltage range (0.2-0.45 mV) was useful to identify areas of reconnection around the PVs. On DE CMRI, a bipolar voltage cutoff of 0.27 mV performed best for delineating scar (sensitivity: 90\%, specificity: 83\%).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing AF ablation, EAM derived LA bipolar voltage shows regional variation. For maps acquired during SR, a voltage range of 0.2-0.45 mV can accurately demarcate LA scar distribution. This can be helpful in identifying PV reconnection in patients undergoing repeat AF ablation.},

	abstract = {Objectives
We evaluated the accuracy of in vivo delayed-enhancement multislice computed tomography (DE-MSCT) and delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) for the assessment of myocardial infarct size using postmortem triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) pathology as standard of reference.
Background
The diagnostic value of DE-MSCT for the assessment of acute reperfused myocardial infarction is currently unclear.
Methods
In 10 domestic pigs (25 to 30 kg), the circumflex coronary artery was balloon-occluded for 2 h followed by reperfusion. After 5 days (3 to 7 days), DE-MRI (1.5-T) was performed 15 min after administration of 0.2 mmol/kg gadolinium-DTPA using an inversion recovery gradient echo technique. On the same day, DE-MSCT (64-slice) was performed 15 min after administration of 1 gI/kg of iodinated contrast material. One day after imaging, hearts were excised, sectioned in 8 mm short-axis slices, and stained with TTC. Infarct size was defined as the hyperenhanced area on DE-MSCT and DE-MRI images and the TTC-negative area on TTC pathology slices. Infarct size was expressed as percentage of total slice area.
Results
Infarct size determined by DE-MSCT and DE-MRI showed a good correlation with infarct size assessed with TTC pathology (R2 = 0.96 [p \&lt; 0.001] and R2 = 0.93 [p \&lt; 0.001], respectively). The correlation between DE-MSCT and DE-MRI was also good (R2 = 0.96; p \&lt; 0.001). The relative difference in CT attenuation value of infarcted myocardium compared to remote myocardium was 191 {\textpm} 18\%. The relative MR signal intensity between infarcted myocardium and remote myocardium was 554 {\textpm} 156\%.
Conclusions
We demonstrated that DE-MSCT can assess acute reperfused myocardial infarction in good agreement with in vivo DE-MRI and TTC pathology.},

This model, derived from the clinical and noninvasive test results of 303 patients under-going angiography at the Cleveland Clink in Cleveland, Ohio, was applied to a group of 425 patients undergoing angiography at the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology in Budapest, Hungary (disease prevalence 38\%); 200 patients undergoing angiography at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Long Beach, California (disease prevalence 75\%); and 143 such patients from the University Hospitals in Zurich and Basel, Switzerland (disease prevalence 84\%). The probabilities that resulted from the application of the Cleveland algorithm were compared with those derived by applying a Bayesian algorithm derived from published medical studies called CADENZA to the same 3 patient test groups. Both algorithms overpredicted the probability of disease at the Hungarian and American centers. Overprediction was more pronounced with the use of CADENZA (average overestimation 16 vs 10\% and 11 vs 5\%, p \&lt; 0.001). In the Swiss group, the discriminant function underestimated (by 7\%) and CADENZA slightly overestimated (by 2\%) disease probability. Clinical utility, assessed as the percentage of patients correctly classified, was modestly superior for the new discriminant function as compared with CADENZA in the Hungarian group and similar in the American and Swiss groups. It was concluded that coronary disease probabilities derived from discriminant functions are reliable and clinically useful when applied to patients with chest pain syndromes and intermediate disease prevalence.},

	abstract = {Real-time three-dimensional ultrasound enables new intracardiac surgical procedures, but the distorted appearance of instruments in ultrasound poses a challenge to surgeons. This paper presents a detection technique that identifies the position of the instrument within the ultrasound volume. The algorithm uses a form of the generalized Radon transform to search for long straight objects in the ultrasound image, a feature characteristic of instruments and not found in cardiac tissue. When combined with passive markers placed on the instrument shaft, the full position and orientation of the instrument is found in 3D space. This detection technique is amenable to rapid execution on the current generation of personal computer graphics processor units (GPU). Our GPU implementation detected a surgical instrument in 31 ms, sufficient for real-time tracking at the 25 volumes per second rate of the ultrasound machine. A water tank experiment found instrument orientation errors of 1.1 degrees and tip position errors of less than 1.8mm. Finally, an in vivo study demonstrated successful instrument tracking inside a beating porcine heart.},

	abstract = {To present and validate a highly automated MRI analysis workflow for image-guided catheter ablation of scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation procedures. A cohort of 15 post-infarction patients underwent MRI prior to VT ablation. The MRI study included a black-blood turbo spin echo sequence for visualizing the aortic root and ostium of the left main (LM) coronary artery, and a 3D late gadolinium enhanced sequence for visualizing the LV anatomy and myocardial scar substrate. Semi-automated segmentation of the LV, aortic root and ostium of LM was performed, followed by fully automated segmentation of myocardial scar. All segmented structures were aligned using an automated image registration algorithm to remove inter-scan displacement. MRI was integrated at the beginning of the procedure after mapping a single LM point. The integration performance was compared to that of the traditional iterative closest point (ICP) method. The proposed method required a single LM mapping point only, compared to 255 {\textpm} 43 points with the ICP method. The single-point method achieved a mean point-to-surface distance of 4.9 {\textpm} 1.5 mm on the LV surface and 5.1 {\textpm} 1.7 mm on the aorta surface (ICP: 3.7 {\textpm} 0.8 and 9.2 {\textpm} 7.2 mm, P {\textless} 0.05). The Cohen{\textquoteright}s kappa coefficient between the MRI-defined and EAM-defined scar was 0.36 {\textpm} 0.16 for the presented method, significantly higher than that of ICP method (0.23 {\textpm} 0.21, P = 0.03), indicating more accurate scar substrate localization during integration. This study demonstrated the feasibility of preprocedural MRI integration into the VT ablation procedure, with highly automated image analysis workflow and minimal mapping effort.},

We hypothesised that fusion of multiple, sequential RT3D volume datasets may improve image quality.

Finally 2D contrast images were obtained of 4, 3 and 2 chamber view.The fused, standard RT3D and 2D contrast views were analysed to compare (i) quality (using the standard segmental approach) and (ii) contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was used as a quantitative measurement of the image quality- defined as the ratio of the signal intensity differences between image regions (myocardium) and the image noise (blood pool).

	abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that success of elective direct-current cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF) can be predicted from clinical features and M-mode echocardiographic left atrial diameter. We evaluated clinical variables as well as M-mode and 2-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of atrial size in 85 patients undergoing electrical cardioversion for AF. Of 65 patients who were initially converted to sinus rhythm, 45 (69\%) and 38 (58\%) remained in sinus rhythm at 1 and 6 months, respectively. No historical feature predicted initial success, although patients with cardiomyopathy or pulmonary disease underlying their AF had significantly lower success rates compared with those having other etiologies. Furthermore, no M-mode or 2-dimensional echocardiographic measurements of atrial size predicted initial success of cardioversion. Maintenance of sinus rhythm at 1 month was related to short duration of AF before cardioversion (\&lt; 3 months vs \&gt; 12 months, p \&lt; 0.05). Left atrial area and long axis dimension by 2-dimensional echocardiography were significantly larger in patients remaining in sinus rhythm than in those who had reverted to AF at 1 month (28 {\textpm} 7 vs 24 {\textpm} 5 cm2 and 65 {\textpm} 9 vs 59 {\textpm} 8 mm, respectively, both p \&lt; 0.05), but overlap was great. No significant difference in atrial dimensions was noted at 6-month follow-up. It appears that, although no clinical or echocardiographic variable predicts initial success for cardioversion of AF, duration of AF does predict maintenance of sinus rhythm 1 month after initial success. Atrial size does not appear to strongly influence outcome of cardioversion and should therefore not be included as an important variable when considering patients for this procedure.},

In this article a 3D motion-correction method is described that is based on image registration of in-plane data and through-plane slice tracking. A number of fast radial undersampled images are acquired, each of which is free of motion artifacts. Initially, in-plane translational and rotational motion between each image was corrected before combining the data to give a fully sampled image. At the next stage, correction of in-plane deformation, in addition to translations and rotations, was performed in the image domain. Through-plane translational motion was compensated using a navigator echo to move the acquisition plane. Using this method, information on the motion of the heart was captured at the same time as acquiring the image data. No motion model, assumptions about the motion, or training data are required. The method is demonstrated on phantom data and cardiac images acquired on free-breathing volunteers.},

Using CE-MDCT, myocardial perfusion defects are often observed in the early phase of the contrast bolus (early defect (ED)), with residual defects (RDs) and late enhancement (LE) observed in the late phase in myocardial infarction (MI). However, the clinical significance of EDs, RDs, and LE has not yet been fully described. This work reviews myocardial viability and function by CE-MDCT based on our prior data by including contrast-enhanced single-slice (detector) CT (CE-SSCT) and CE-MDCT. Recently, equivalent results were obtained, as seen in CE-SSCT with images by CE-MDCT. In this review, images that were acquired by MDCT will be presented. In this work, the following items will be the focus: myocardial enhancement patterns (EDs, LE, and RDs), early perfusion defects and their relationship to wall thickness (WT) and wall motion, early CT perfusion defects vs. Tl-201 single photon emission CT (SPECT), the protocol for performing dual-phase contrast CT, classification of enhancement patterns, enhancement patterns on dual-phase CE-MDCT vs. left ventricular functional recovery and WT, changes in enhancement patterns in conjunction with healing stage, enhancement patterns on dual-phase CE-MDCT vs. 201Tl/99mTc-pyrophosphate (dual-isotope SPECT), the clinical meaning of each enhancement pattern, pitfalls of enhancement patterns and other diseases, and study limitations and the future of MDCT.},

	abstract = {We previously presented an image registration method, referred to hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration (HAMMER), which demonstrated relatively high accuracy in inter-subject registration of MR brain images. However, the HAMMER algorithm requires the pre-segmentation of brain tissues, since the attribute vectors used to hierarchically match the corresponding pairs of points are defined from the segmented image. In many applications, the segmentation of tissues might be difficult, unreliable or even impossible to complete, which potentially limits the use of the HAMMER algorithm in more generalized applications. To overcome this limitation, we have used local spatial intensity histograms to design a new type of attribute vector for each point in an intensity image. The histogram-based attribute vector is rotationally invariant, and importantly it also captures spatial information by integrating a number of local intensity histograms from multi-resolution images of original intensity image. The new attribute vectors are able to determine the corresponding points across individual images. Therefore, by hierarchically matching new attribute vectors, the proposed method can perform as successfully as the previous HAMMER algorithm did in registering MR brain images, while providing more generalized applications in registering images of various organs. Experimental results show good performance of the proposed method in registering MR brain images, DTI brain images, CT pelvis images, and MR mouse images.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.hrthm.2011.09.062},
	abstract = {Background
Ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may require adjunctive methods of substrate modification. Both ablation-targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear.
Methods
Twenty patients (age 62 {\textpm} 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 {\textpm} 6 years, 4 males) underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated with SR fractionation.
Results
SRF (338 {\textpm} 150 points) and CFAE (418 {\textpm} 135 points) regions comprised 29\% {\textpm} 14\% and 25\% {\textpm} 15\% of the left atrial surface area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75\% {\textpm} 13\% of the time.
Conclusions
(1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not be a suitable ablation target.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 34 patients with disease of the aorta or its major branches or both were randomly assigned to receive a dose of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 mmol of gadopentetate dimeglumine per kilogram of body weight. Initially, contrast agent transit times were measured with use of a turbo fast-low-angle-shot sequence. Subsequently, a three-dimensional fast imaging with steady-state precession sequence (7.3-msec repetition time, 2.8-msec echo time) was used for breath-hold MR angiography. Gadopentetate dimeglumine was injected with an MR-compatible power injector. Efficacy was evaluated by measurement of vessel enhancement and by clinical correlation of MR angiograms with x-ray angiograms. RESULTS: Evaluation of contrast agent transit time was possible in all patients with the test doses, which provided contrast-enhanced MR angiograms of constant quality. Neither vessel enhancement nor diagnostic information was significantly different across the these study groups. CONCLUSION: The clinical gadolinium dose of 0.1 mmol/kg is sufficient for diagnostic assessment of the aorta and its major branches at contrast-enhanced MR angiography. High-dose studies appear not to be required for these large vessels.},

	abstract = {Introduction: No prior studies have reported the use of integrated electroanatomic mapping with preacquired magnetic resonance/computed tomographic (MR/CT) images to guide catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a series of patients. Methods and Results: Sixteen consecutive patients with drug-refractory AF underwent catheter ablation under the guidance of a three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomic mapping system (Carto, Biosense Webster, Inc., Diamond Bar, CA, USA). Gadolinium-enhanced MR (n = 8) or contrast-enhanced high-resolution CT (n = 8) imaging was performed within 1 day prior to the ablation procedures. Using a novel software package (CartoMerge, Biosense Webster, Inc.), the left atrium (LA) with pulmonary veins (PVs) was segmented and extracted for image registration. The segmented 3D MR/CT LA reconstruction was accurately registered to the real-time mapping space with a combination of landmark registration and surface registration. The registered 3D MR/CT LA reconstruction was successfully used to guide deployment of RF applications encircling the PVs. Upon completion of the circumferential lesions around the PVs, 32\% of the PVs were electrically isolated. Guided by a circular mapping catheter, the remaining PVs were disconnected from the LA using a segmental approach. The distance between the surface of the registered 3D MR/CT LA reconstruction and multiple electroanatomic map points was 3.05 {\textpm} 0.41 mm. No complications were observed. Conclusions: Three-dimensional MR/CT images can be successfully extracted and registered to anatomically guided clinical AF ablations. The display of detailed and accurate anatomic information during the procedure enables tailored RF ablation to individual PV and LA anatomy.},

	abstract = {Objectives~
The goals of this study were to determine: 1) if low-risk patients assessed by a CHADS2 score, a clinical scoring system quantifying a risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), require a routine screening transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) before pulmonary vein isolation (PVI); and 2) the relationship of a CHADS2 score with left atrial (LA)/left atrial appendage (LAA) spontaneous echo contrast, sludge, and thrombus.Background
There is no clear consensus of whether a screening TEE before catheter ablation of AF should be performed in every patient.Methods
Initial TEEs for pre-PVI of 1,058 AF patients (age 57 {\textpm} 11 years, 80\% men) were reviewed and compared with a CHADS2 score.Results
CHADS2 scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were present in 47\%, 33\%, 14\%, 5\%, 1\%, 0.3\%, and 0\% of patients, respectively. The prevalence of LA/LAA thrombus, sludge, and spontaneous echo contrast were present in 0.6\%, 1.5\%, and 35\%. The prevalence of LA/LAA thrombus/sludge increased with ascending CHADS2 score (scores 0 [0\%], 1 [2\%], 2 [5\%], 3 [9\%], and 4 to 6 [11\%], p {\textless} 0.01). No patient with a CHADS2 score of 0 had LA/LAA sludge/thrombus. In a multivariate model, history of congestive heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}35\% were significantly associated with sludge/thrombus.Conclusions
The prevalence of LA/LAA sludge/thrombus in patients with AF undergoing a pre-PVI screening TEE is very low ({\textless}2\%) and increases significantly with higher CHADS2 scores. This suggests that a screening TEE before PVI should be performed in patients with a CHADS2 score of >=1, and in patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 when the AF is persistent and therapeutic anticoagulation has not been maintained for 4 weeks before the procedure.},

	abstract = {Background:Circumferential radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) around the orifices of the pulmonary veins (PV) is a curative catheter-based therapy of paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF). Integration of multislice computed tomography into three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping to guide catheter ablation has been shown to be accurate and feasible. This study investigated whether the use of such sophisticated imaging technology translates into better clinical outcomes, procedural efficacy, and safety in comparison with a control group treated with conventional three-dimensional electroanatomic mapping.Methods:A total of 100 consecutive patients (85 male, mean age 55 {\textpm} 9 years) with multi-drug-resistant AF underwent RFCA. In this study we used a wide area circumferential approach with confirmed PV isolation (requiring additional ablations at the ostial level) and further lines as needed.Results:Comparison of outcome data between the conventional electroanatomic mapping (Carto XP, Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) and the image integration technology (Carto MERGE, Biosense Webster) resulted in a significant improvement in procedural success for the image integration group (85.1\% vs 67.9\%; P = 0.018). No single case of significant PV stenosis occurred in the Carto MERGE group versus three significant stenoses in the conventional group (P = 0.098). Both procedure and fluoroscopy times remained unchanged.Conclusion:Multislice computed tomography image integration into electroanatomic mapping significantly improves the success of wide area circumferential ablation with confirmed isolation of the PV and additional lines. In addition, the safety of radiofrequency ablation with regard to the occurrence of PV stenosis is increased in comparison with a control group using conventional electroanatomic mapping alone. Procedural efficacy remains unchanged.},

	abstract = {Background-- New ablation strategies for atrial fibrillation or nonidiopathic ventricular tachycardia are increasingly based on anatomic consideration and require the placement of ablation lesions at the correct anatomic locations. This study sought to evaluate the accuracy of the first clinically available image integration system for catheter ablation on 3-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) images in real time. Methods and Results-- After midline sternotomy, 2.3-mm CT fiducial markers were attached to the epicardial surface of each cardiac chamber in 9 mongrel dogs. Detailed 3D cardiac anatomy was reconstructed from contrast-enhanced, high-resolution CT images and registered to the electroanatomic maps of each cardiac chamber. To assess accuracy, targeted ablations were performed at each of the fiducial markers guided only by the reconstructed 3D images. At autopsy, the position error was 1.9\{+/-\}0.9 mm for the right atrium, 2.7\{+/-\}1.2 mm for the right ventricle, 1.8\{+/-\}1.0 mm for the left atrium, and 2.3\{+/-\}1.1 mm for the left ventricle. To evaluate the system's guidance of more complex clinical ablation strategies, ablations of the cavotricuspid isthmus (n=4), fossa ovalis (n=4), and pulmonary veins (n=6) were performed, which resulted in position errors of 1.8\{+/-\}1.5, 2.2\{+/-\}1.3, and 2.1\{+/-\}1.2 mm, respectively. Retrospective analysis revealed that a combination of landmark registration and the target chamber surface registration resulted in {\textless}3 mm accuracy in all 4 cardiac chambers. Conclusions-- Image integration with high-resolution 3D CT allows accurate placement of anatomically guided ablation lesions and can facilitate complex ablation strategies. This may provide significant advantages for anatomically based procedures such as ablation of atrial fibrillation and nonidiopathic ventricular tachycardia.},

This integration asks for finding a mapping between electro-anatomical voltage mapping and delay-enhancement magnetic resonance images. We present an evaluation of the accuracy of some mapping strategies, including different standard rigid and non-rigid registration techniques. We also developed a new mapping algorithm to be applied once both geometries are roughly aligned to improve the currently used simple closest point projection. The new mapping algorithm is based on establishing a homeomorphism between both surfaces using a common surface parametrization computed by mesh flattening, then preserving all original information in both modalities. We applied the different mapping strategies to clinical and synthetic data. Results demonstrated a substantial reduction of the point-to-surface error when using the non-rigid registration technique and an improved substrate overlap when using the proposed mapping algorithm.},

Yet there is no imaging modality to identify patients at risk, provide accurate diagnosis and guide therapy. Standard diagnostic techniques such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) provide only low-resolution projections of cardiac electrical activity on the body surface. Here we demonstrate the successful application in humans of a new imaging modality called electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI), which noninvasively images cardiac electrical activity in the heart. In ECGI, a multielectrode vest records 224 body-surface electrocardiograms; electrical potentials, electrograms and isochrones are then reconstructed on the heart's surface using geometrical information from computed tomography (CT) and a mathematical algorithm. We provide examples of ECGI application during atrial and ventricular activation and ventricular repolarization in (i) normal heart (ii) heart with a conduction disorder (right bundle branch block) (iii) focal activation initiated by right or left ventricular pacing, and (iv) atrial flutter.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash}Atrial fibrillation ablation has made tremendous progress with respect to innovation, efficacy, and safety. However, limited data exist regarding the burden and trends in adverse outcomes arising from this procedure. The aim of our study was to examine the frequency of adverse events attributable to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation and the influence of operator and hospital volume on outcomes.
Methods and Results{\textemdash}With the use of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified AF patients treated with catheter ablation. We investigated common complications including cardiac perforation and tamponade, pneumothorax, stroke, transient ischemic attack, vascular access complications (hemorrhage/hematoma, vascular complications requiring surgical repair, and accidental arterial puncture), and in-hospital death described with AF ablation, and we defined these complications by using validated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. An estimated 93 801 AF ablations were performed from 2000 to 2010. The overall frequency of complications was 6.29\% with combined cardiac complications (2.54\%) being the most frequent. Cardiac complications were followed by vascular complications (1.53\%), respiratory complications (1.3\%), and neurological complications (1.02\%). The in-hospital mortality was 0.46\%. Annual operator ({\textless}25 procedures) and hospital volume ({\textless}50 procedures) were significantly associated with adverse outcomes. There was a small (nonsignificant) rise in overall complication rates.
Conclusions{\textemdash}The overall complication rate was 6.29\% in patients undergoing AF ablation. There was a significant association between operator and hospital volume and adverse outcomes. This suggests a need for future research into identifying the safety measures in AF ablations and instituting appropriate interventions to improve overall AF ablation outcomes.},

We have created DRACOs and shown that they are nontoxic in 11 mammalian cell types and effective against 15 different viruses, including dengue flavivirus, Amapari and Tacaribe arenaviruses, Guama bunyavirus, and H1N1 influenza. We have also demonstrated that DRACOs can rescue mice challenged with H1N1 influenza. DRACOs have the potential to be effective therapeutics or prophylactics for numerous clinical and priority viruses, due to the broad-spectrum sensitivity of the dsRNA detection domain, the potent activity of the apoptosis induction domain, and the novel direct linkage between the two which viruses have never encountered.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: A specific left atrial (LA) linear lesion concept for treatment of paroxysmal and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) was tested using intraoperative ablation with minimally invasive surgical techniques.
BACKGROUND: Curative treatment for patients with chronic AF is among the main challenges of interventional electrophysiology.
METHODS: Seventy patients (mean age 53 +/- 10 years) with drug-refractory persistent (n = 28) or paroxysmal (n = 42) AF underwent intraoperative radiofrequency (RF) ablation using video-assisted minimally invasive techniques via a right anterolateral minithoracotomy. Contiguous lesion lines involving the mitral annulus and the orifices of the pulmonary veins were placed with RF energy application under direct vision to prevent anatomically defined LA re-entrant circuits.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 18 +/- 7 months in patients with permanent AF and 18 +/- 5 months in patients with paroxysmal AF. Antiarrhythmic drug treatment was instituted in patients with postoperative atrial arrhythmias to allow "reverse electrical remodeling" and was discontinued after three months. Six months following ablation, 93\% of the patients were in sinus rhythm in both groups, and after 12 months, 95\% and 97\%, respectively. As major complications, one esophagus perforation and one circumflex coronary artery stenosis were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: A pure linear lesion line concept confined to the left atrium targeting specifically at elimination of anatomically defined LA "anchor" re-entrant circuits eliminated AF in {\textgreater}90\% of the patients treated with intraoperative ablation using minimally invasive surgical techniques over a mean follow-up of 1.5 years.},

However, the storage and computational requirements of the Hough Transform preclude practical applications. Although there are many modifications to the Hough Transform, these modifications still demand significant storage requirement. In this paper, we present a novel ellipse detection algorithm which retains the original advantages of the Hough Transform while minimizing the storage and computation complexity. More specifically, we use an accumulator that is only one dimensional. As such, our algorithm is more effective in terms of storage requirement. In addition, our algorithm can be easily parallelized to achieve good execution time. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our algorithm in which both complete and incomplete ellipses can be extracted.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach to shape-based segmentation and tracking of deformable anatomical structures in medical images, and validate this approach by detecting and tracking the endocardial contour in an echocardiographic image sequence. To this end, some global prior shape knowledge of the endocardial boundary is captured by a prototype template with a set of predefined global and local deformations to take into account its inherent natural variability over time. In this deformable model-based Bayesian segmentation, the data likelihood model relies on an accurate statistical modelling of the grey level distribution of each class present in the ultrasound image. The parameters of this distribution mixture are given by a preliminary iterative estimation step. This estimation scheme relies on a Markov Random Field prior model, and takes into account the imaging process as well as the distribution shape of each class present in the image. Then the detection and the tracking problem is stated in a Bayesian framework, where it ends up as a cost function minimisation problem for each image of the sequence. In our application, this energy optimisation problem is efficiently solved by a genetic algorithm combined with a steepest ascent procedure. This technique has been successfully applied on synthetic images, and on a real echocardiographic image sequence.},

We present an algorithm for automatic segmentation of the LV myocardium in 2D and 3D sequences which employs learning optical flow (OF) strategies. OF motion estimation is used to propagate single-frame segmentation results of the Random Forest classifier from one frame to the next. The best strategy for propagating between frames is learned on a per-frame basis. We demonstrate that our algorithm is fast and accurate. We also show that OF propagation increases the performance of the method with respect to the static baseline procedure, and that learning the best OF propagation strategy performs better than single-strategy OF propagation.},

Methods and Results{\textemdash}We examined the mortality of subjects 55 to 94 years of age who developed AF during 40 years of follow-up of the original Framingham Heart Study cohort. Of the original 5209 subjects, 296 men and 325 women (mean ages, 74 and 76 years, respectively) developed AF and met eligibility criteria. By pooled logistic regression, after adjustment for age, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, and stroke or transient ischemic attack, AF was associated with an OR for death of 1.5 (95\% CI, 1.2 to 1.8) in men and 1.9 (95\% CI, 1.5 to 2.2) in women. The risk of mortality conferred by AF did not significantly vary by age. However, there was a significant AF-sex interaction: AF diminished the female advantage in survival. In secondary multivariate analyses, in subjects free of valvular heart disease and preexisting cardiovascular disease, AF remained significantly associated with excess mortality, with about a doubling of mortality in both sexes.
Conclusions{\textemdash}In subjects from the original cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, AF was associated with a 1.5- to 1.9-fold mortality risk after adjustment for the preexisting cardiovascular conditions with which AF was related.

The mechanism of this delayed enhancement in myocardial infarctions (MIs) is hypothesized to result from altered kinetics and changes in the volumes of distribution in the myocardium. Pharmacokinetic models with two and three compartments were fitted to the concentration-time curves of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data obtained from five patients with known MI. Furthermore, the parameter stability was investigated in simulations for the two different models. The transfer constants and volumes of distribution showed a good correlation with imaging findings on early and delayed contrast-enhanced MRI. The two compartment model showed higher parameter stability. The three compartment model allows a more in-depth quantification of myocardial scarring. These models have the potential to improve the diagnosis of myocardial pathologies involving scar, with differing kinetics and volumes of distribution such as infarction or cardiomyopathy.

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash}For the past decade, electric pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) has become a procedure implemented worldwide for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Currently, 2 main approaches are used for PVI: ostial isolation of the PVs and wide antral PVI. The aims of this systematic review are to evaluate the relative merits of each technique with a pooled comparative analysis of efficacy and complications.
Methods and Results{\textemdash}Studies were identified by searching electronic databases for studies on ostial versus antral PVI. Information was extracted from each included trial. Odds ratio was the primary measure of treatment effect or side effects. The proportion of patients with recurrences of atrial fibrillation or other atrial tachyarrhythmias was evaluated at the end of the follow-up periods in 12 trials, including 1183 patients. The recurrence rate of total supraventricular arrhythmias was significantly lower in wide antral than in segmental PVI group (odds ratio, 0.42; 95\% confidence interval, 0.32{\textendash}0.56; P{\textless}0.00001). Atrial fibrillation recurrence was significantly lower in the wide antral group (odds ratio, 0.33; 95\% confidence interval, 0.24{\textendash}0.46; P{\textless}0,00001). A trend toward a higher incidence of left atrial tachycardia occurrence in the wide antral circumferential ablation group was detected, which did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio, 1.53; 95\% confidence interval, 0.88{\textendash}2.69; P=0.13).
Conclusions{\textemdash}Our primary finding is that PVI performed with a wide antral approach is more effective than ostial PVI in achieving freedom from total atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence at long-term follow-up.},

	abstract = {Background After cardioversion of sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), the electrical and contractile functions of the atria are impaired, and recurrences of AF frequently occur. Whether remodeling of the structure of atrial myocardium is the basis for this problem is not known.
Methods and Results Sustained AF was induced by electrical pacing in 13 goats instrumented long-term. The goats were killed after 9 to 23 weeks, and the atrial myocardium was examined by light and electron microscopy. The changes were quantified in left and right atrial free walls, appendages, trabeculae, the interatrial septum, and the bundle of Bachmann. A substantial proportion of the atrial myocytes (up to 92\%) revealed marked changes in their cellular substructures, such as loss of myofibrils, accumulation of glycogen, changes in mitochondrial shape and size, fragmentation of sarcoplasmic reticulum, and dispersion of nuclear chromatin. These changes were accompanied by an increase in size of the myocytes (up to 195\%). There were virtually no signs of cellular degeneration, and the interstitial space remained unaltered. The duration of sustained AF did not significantly affect the degree of myolytic cell changes.
Conclusions Sustained AF in goats leads to predominantly structural changes in the atrial myocytes similar to those seen in ventricular myocytes from chronic hibernating myocardium. These structural changes may explain the depressed contractile function of atrial myocardium after cardioversion. This goat model of AF offers a new approach to study the cascade of events leading to sustained AF and its maintenance.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash} We evaluated whether contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography (CE-MDCT) might characterize myocardial infarct (MI) with patterns similar to those obtained by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (CE-MR) and studied the underlying mechanisms.
Methods and Results{\textemdash} In vivo infarct characterization by CE-MDCT was shown to be feasible between 4 and 20 minutes after contrast injection in 7 pigs with MI. Subsequently, in 16 patients with acute MI and 21 patients with chronic MI, contrast patterns by CE-MDCT were related to CE-MR. Eighteen patients had hypoenhanced regions on early CE-MDCT images at the time of coronary imaging, and 34 patients had hyperenhanced regions on images acquired 10 minutes later. On a segmental basis, there was moderately good concordance of early hypoenhanced regions (92\%, $\kappa$=0.54, P{\textless}0.001) and late hyperenhanced regions (82\%, $\kappa$=0.61, P{\textless}0.001) between CE-MDCT and CE-MR. Absolute sizes of early hypoenhanced (6{\textpm}16 versus 7{\textpm}16 g, P=0.25) and late hyperenhanced (36{\textpm}34 versus 31{\textpm}40 g, P=0.14) regions were similar on CE-MDCT and CE-MR and were highly correlated (r=0.93, P{\textless}0.001 and r=0.89, P{\textless}0.001 respectively). In 8 retrogradely perfused infarcted rabbit hearts, contrast kinetics of iomeprol were similar to gadodiamide, ie, slow wash in (8.7{\textpm}6.7 versus 1.2{\textpm}0.3 minutes, P{\textless}0.001) in infarct core and slow washout (20{\textpm}12 versus 2.5{\textpm}0.5 minutes, P{\textless}0.001) in both infarct core and rim compared with the remote region.
Conclusions{\textemdash} Because iodated contrast agents have similar kinetics in infarcted and noninfarcted myocardium as gadolinium DPTA, CE-MDCT can characterize acute and chronic MI with contrast patterns similar to CE-MR. CE-MDCT may thus provide important information on infarct size and viability at the time of noninvasive coronary imaging.},

	abstract = {Background:~
Contemporary clinical risk stratification schemata for predicting stroke and thromboembolism (TE) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are largely derived from risk factors identified from trial cohorts. Thus, many potential risk factors have not been included.Methods:
We refined the 2006 Birmingham/National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stroke risk stratification schema into a risk factor-based approach by reclassifying and/or incorporating additional new risk factors where relevant. This schema was then compared with existing stroke risk stratification schema in a real-world cohort of patients with AF (n = 1,084) from the Euro Heart Survey for AF.Results:
Risk categorization differed widely between the different schemes compared. Patients classified as high risk ranged from 10.2\% with the Framingham schema to 75.7\% with the Birmingham 2009 schema. The classic CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age {\textgreater} 75, Diabetes, prior Stroke/transient ischemic attack) schema categorized the largest proportion (61.9\%) into the intermediate-risk strata, whereas the Birmingham 2009 schema classified 15.1\% into this category. The Birmingham 2009 schema classified only 9.2\% as low risk, whereas the Framingham scheme categorized 48.3\% as low risk. Calculated C-statistics suggested modest predictive value of all schema for TE. The Birmingham 2009 schema fared marginally better (C-statistic, 0.606) than CHADS2. However, those classified as low risk by the Birmingham 2009 and NICE schema were truly low risk with no TE events recorded, whereas TE events occurred in 1.4\% of low-risk CHADS2 subjects. When expressed as a scoring system, the Birmingham 2009 schema (CHA2DS2-VASc acronym) showed an increase in TE rate with increasing scores (P value for trend = .003).Conclusions:
Our novel, simple stroke risk stratification schema, based on a risk factor approach, provides some improvement in predictive value for TE over the CHADS2 schema, with low event rates in low-risk subjects and the classification of only a small proportion of subjects into the intermediate-risk category. This schema could improve our approach to stroke risk stratification in patients with AF.},

The method is built around a weak parts-based shape model {\textendash} the Boundary Fragment Model (BFM) {\textendash} which represents an object by sections of its boundary. Following previous literature, we use the BFM in a boosted classifier framework to first automatically detect the object of interest. Extending previous work, we use the BFM to drive a classifier which isolates boundary candidates from spurious and irrelevant edge responses. The application of our algorithm leads to a labelled edge map which encodes the positions of (multiple) object boundaries.

By way of illustrating what is a general solution, the task of identifying the endocardium and epicardium in three-dimensional ultrasound images is completely examined, including a detailed analysis of the parameters which impact on the model construction, the structure of the learned edge response classifier, and implementation concerns. For completeness, we also demonstrate how the output boundary positions can be used in a full model-based segmentation framework.},

	abstract = {PV Ablation for Persistent Atrial Fibrillation. Introduction: Effectiveness of antral pulmonary vein isolation (PVAI) and ablation of non-PV triggers (non-PVTA) in controlling longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) has not been reported. We sought to describe clinical outcomes with this ablation strategy in patients (pts) followed for at least 1 year. Methods: Two hundred pts underwent PVAI for longstanding persistent AF and were followed for recurrence. Thirty-three pts with {\textless}1-year follow-up and 37 pts with additional RF atrial ablation were excluded, leaving 130 pts for analysis. Results: All 130 pts (108 men, mean LA 4.7~{\textpm}~0.6 cm, mean AF duration of 38~{\textpm}~44 months) underwent PVAI with entrance/exit block. In addition, 24 pts (15 pts during the initial procedure and 9 additional pts at repeat ablations) had 40 non-PVTA, including 3 with AVNRT. During follow-up, atrial flutter (AFL) was noted in 7 (5\%) pts. The AF-free survival after single procedure without antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) was 38\%. Repeat AF or AFL ablation was performed in 37 pts (28\%) with PV reconnection uniformly identified (3.7~{\textpm}~0.5 veins/pt). During mean follow-up of 41.1~{\textpm}~23.8 months (range 12{\textendash}103 months), 85/130 pts (65\%) were in sinus rhythm with 65 pts (50\%) off AAD, 20 pts (15\%) on AAD. Additionally, 9 pts (7\%) have had rare episodes of AF such that 72\% of pts have had good long-term clinical outcome. Of the 36 pts with recurrent AF, 20 pts have not had a repeat procedure. Conclusions: PVAI with non-PVTA for longstanding persistent AF provides good long-term AF control in over 70\% of patients with infrequent (5\%) AFL. AAD therapy and repeat PVAI may be required for this optimal outcome. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 23, pp. 806-813, August 2012)},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Ablation has become an important tool in treating atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, yet the recurrence rates remain high. It is well established that ablation lines can be discontinuous and that conduction through the gaps in ablation lines can be affected by tissue heating. In this study, we looked at the effect of tissue conductivity and propagation of electric wave fronts across ablation lines with gaps, using both simulations and an animal model.


METHODS AND RESULTS

For the simulations, we implemented a 2-dimensional bidomain model of the cardiac syncytium, simulating ablation lines with gaps of varying lengths, conductivity, and orientation. For the animal model, transmural ablation lines with a gap were created in 7 mongrel dogs. The gap length was progressively decreased until there was conduction block. The ablation line with a gap was then imaged using MRI and was correlated with histology. With normal conductivity in the gap and the ablation line oriented parallel to the fiber direction, the simulation predicted that the maximum gap length that exhibited conduction block was 1.4 mm. As the conductivity was decreased, the maximum gap length with conduction block increased substantially, that is, with a conductivity of 67\% of normal, the maximum gap length with conduction block increased to 4 mm. In the canine studies, the maximum gap length that displayed conduction block acutely as measured by gross pathology correlated well (R(2) of 0.81) with that measured by MRI.


CONCLUSIONS

Conduction block can occur across discontinuous ablation lines. Moreover, with recovery of conductivity over time, ablation lines with large gaps exhibiting acute conduction block may recover propagation in the gap over time, allowing recurrences of arrhythmias. The ability to see gaps acutely using MRI will allow for targeting these sites for ablation.},

	abstract = {Objectives~ 
 We hypothesized that human atrial fibrillation (AF) may be sustained by localized sources (electrical rotors and focal impulses), whose elimination (focal impulse and rotor modulation [FIRM]) may improve outcome from AF ablation.Background~ 
 Catheter ablation for AF is a promising therapy, whose success is limited in part by uncertainty in the mechanisms that sustain AF. We developed a computational approach to map whether AF is sustained by several meandering waves (the prevailing hypothesis) or localized sources, then prospectively tested whether targeting patient-specific mechanisms revealed by mapping would improve AF ablation outcome.Methods~ 
 We recruited 92 subjects during 107 consecutive ablation procedures for paroxysmal or persistent (72\%) AF. Cases were prospectively treated, in a 2-arm 1:2 design, by ablation at sources (FIRM-guided) followed by conventional ablation (n = 36), or conventional ablation alone (n = 71; FIRM-blinded).Results~ 
 Localized rotors or focal impulses were detected in 98 (97\%) of 101 cases with sustained AF, each exhibiting 2.1 {\textpm} 1.0 sources. The acute endpoint (AF termination or consistent slowing) was achieved in 86\% of FIRM-guided cases versus 20\% of FIRM-blinded cases (p {\textless} 0.001). FIRM ablation alone at the primary source terminated AF in a median 2.5 min (interquartile range: 1.0 to 3.1 min). Total ablation time did not differ between groups (57.8 {\textpm} 22.8 min vs. 52.1 {\textpm} 17.8 min, p = 0.16). During a median 273 days (interquartile range: 132 to 681 days) after a single procedure, FIRM-guided cases had higher freedom from AF (82.4\% vs. 44.9\%; p {\textless} 0.001) after a single procedure than FIRM-blinded cases with rigorous, often implanted, electrocardiography monitoring. Adverse events did not differ between groups.Conclusions~ 
 Localized electrical rotors and focal impulse sources are prevalent sustaining mechanisms for human AF. FIRM ablation at patient-specific sources acutely terminated or slowed AF, and improved outcome. These results offer a novel mechanistic framework and treatment paradigm for AF.

The major image processing challenges are the low-image quality and the processing of information at high-frame rate. This paper presents comparative results for ASD tracking in time sequences of 3D volumes of cardiac ultrasound. We introduce a block flow technique, which combines the velocity computation from optical flow for an entire block with template matching. Enforcing adapted similarity constraints to both the previous and first frames ensures optimal and unique solutions. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with that of block matching and region-based optical flow on eight in vivo 4D datasets acquired from porcine beating-heart procedures. Results show that our technique is more stable and has higher sensitivity than both optical flow and block matching in tracking ASDs. Computing velocity at the block level, our technique tracks ASD motion at 2 frames/s, much faster than optical flow and comparable in computation cost to block matching, and shows promise for real-time (30 frames/s). We report consistent results on clinical intra-operative images and retrieve the cardiac cycle (in ungated images) from error analysis. Quantitative results are evaluated on synthetic data with maximum tracking errors of 1 voxel.},

	abstract = {Background
The measurement of late gadolinium{\textendash}enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) intensity in arbitrary units limits the objectivity of thresholds for focal scar detection and interpatient comparisons of scar burden.
Objective
To develop and validate a normalized measure, the image intensity ratio (IIR), for the assessment of left atrial (LA) scar on LGE-MRI.
Methods
Electrocardiogram- and respiratory-gated 1.5 Tesla LGE-MRI was performed in 75 patients (75\% men; 62 {\textpm} 8 years) before atrial fibrillation ablation. The local IIR was defined as LA myocardial signal intensity for each of the 20 sectors on contiguous axial image planes divided by the mean LA blood pool image intensity. Intracardiac point-by-point sampled electroanatomic map points were coregistered with the corresponding image sectors.
Results
The average bipolar voltage for all 8153 electroanatomic map points was 0.9 {\textpm} 1.1 mV. In a mixed effects model accounting for within patient clustering, and adjusting for age, LA volume, mass, body mass index, sex, CHA2DS2-VASc score, atrial fibrillation type, history of previous ablations, and contrast delay time, each unit increase in local IIR was associated with 91.3\% decrease in bipolar LA voltage (P \&lt; .001). Local IIR thresholds of \&gt;0.97 and \&gt;1.61 corresponded to bipolar voltage \&lt;0.5 and \&lt;0.1 mV, respectively.
Conclusions
Normalization of LGE-MRI intensity by the mean blood pool intensity results in a metric that is closely associated with intracardiac voltage as a surrogate of atrial fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Purpose:
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a heritable autoinflammatory disease characterized by substantial neutrophil influx at sites of serosal and synovial involvement. Inflammatory attacks are usually prevented by prophylaxis with colchicine, a microtubule inhibitor. Pyrin, the FMF protein, colocalizes with microtubules and may impact leukocyte cytoskeletal functions such as adhesion and migration. We therefore sought to further investigate leukocyte migration in FMF.
Method:
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 25 treated patients, 10 untreated patients, and 16 controls. Subsets of patients were studied in several assays. Mononuclear cells were stimulated for 24 hours with TLR ligands 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Chemokines produced from cultured supernatants and from serum samples were evaluated with the Luminex immunoassay. Analysis of gene expression sequences with the Affymetrix system was utilized in 8-paired patient samples who underwent colchicine withdrawal. Chemotaxis assays included a transwell system and a live imaging protocol with both patient granulocytes and the neutrophil-like PLB cell line transfected with V726A, M680I, and M694V pyrin mutations, stimulated to various chemoattractants, including MIP-1 alpha, IL-8 and fMLP.
Results:
Microarray analysis revealed a "chemotactic signature" induced by colchicine withdrawal with upregulation of major chemotactic genes including CRK and Integrin beta-1, and downregulation of genes involving chemokine receptors and cell adhesion molecules such as CCR 7 and CXCR3. Moreover, neutrophil activation was increased, as seen with the downregulation of the L-selectin marker, CD 62L. Asymptomatic FMF patients on colchicine showed elevated serum levels of the chemokines, MIP-1 alpha and beta, as compared to controls. In addition, mononuclear cells from treated patients stimulated ex-vivo, suggest a role for TLR4, 5, and 9 in the modulation of chemokines, specifically MIP-1 alpha and beta. Patients off colchicine demonstrated significant hyperresponsive cell movement compared with treated patients and controls, although such movement was found to be random (chemokinetic) and less directed (chemotactic) when visualized. By transwell analysis of the transfected neutrophil-like PLB cell line hypermobility was more apparent with the V726A mutation.
Conclusion:
A cascade of intracellular events involving chemokine signaling can impact leukocyte migration in FMF. This study has focused on determining the extent to which these effects represent the underlying pathophysiology of FMF, independent of colchicine.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Preprocedural cardiac imaging (CT/MRI) and intraprocedural electroanatomical mapping (EAM) are commonly used during left atrial (LA) catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). In the optimal scenario, the imaging datasets would be directly integrated with the EAM system to guide catheter mapping based on the accurate individual cardiac anatomy. Methods and Results: Strategies to align the EAM and imaging data were assessed by simulations using a life-size model of the LA and aorta. This revealed that the optimal strategy includes mapping both the aorta and LA. Respiratory changes in cardiac anatomy were evaluated by MR angiography performed in 10 patients during both inspiration and expiration. Comparison of paired images revealed inferior and anterior movement of the LA relative to the aorta with inspiration. Next, image integration was employed in a series of patients (n = 13) scheduled for AF catheter ablation. After preprocedural CT angiography (7 during inspiration and 6 during expiration), three-dimensional anatomical renderings of these images were integrated with the EAM data in a custom workstation to permit real-time catheter manipulation within these constructs. The electrophysiologist was blinded to these integrated images, but the accuracy of the process was assessed real-time by a second operator. This revealed poor alignment during inspiration but good alignment during expiration{\textemdash}the respiratory phase most closely resembling that during EAM. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility of integrating preacquired cardiac images with real-time electroanatomical mapping to guide catheter movement in the LA in a reliable and clinically relevant manner.},

Electrical remodeling (shortening of atrial refractoriness) develops within the first days of AF and contributes to an increase in stability of AF. However, {\textquoteleft}domestication of AF{\textquoteright} must also depend on a {\textquoteleft}second factor{\textquoteright} since the persistence of AF continues to increase after electrical remodeling has been completed. Atrial contractile remodeling (loss of contractility) leads to a reduced atrial transport function after cardioversion of AF. An important clinical consequence is that during several days after restoration of sinus rhythm, the risk of atrial thrombus formation is still high. In addition, the reduction of atrial contractility during AF may enhance atrial dilatation which may add to the persistence of AF. Tachycardia-induced structural remodeling takes place in a different time domain (weeks to months). Myolysis probably contributes to the loss of atrial contractile force. Although it might explain the loss of efficacy of pharmacological cardioversion and the development of permanent AF, the role of structural remodeling in the progression of AF is still unclear. Atrial structural remodeling also occurs as a result of heart failure and other underlying cardiovascular diseases. The associated atrial fibrosis might explain intra-atrial conduction disturbances and the susceptibility for AF. Thus, both AF itself and the underlying heart disease are responsible for the development of the arrhythmogenic substrate. New strategies for prevention and termination of AF should be build on our knowledge of the mechanisms and time course of AF-induced atrial remodeling.},

	abstract = {Real-time three-dimensional ultrasound (RT3D US) is an ideal imaging modality for the diagnosis of cardiac disease. RT3D US is a flexible, inexpensive, non-invasive tool that provides important diagnostic information related to cardiac function. Unfortunately, RT3D US suffers from inherent shortcomings, such as low signal-to-noise ratio and limited field of view, producing images that are difficult to interpret. Multi-modal dynamic cardiac image registration is a well-recognized approach that compensates for these deficiencies while retaining the advantages of RT3D US imaging. The clinical application of multi-modal image registration methods is difficult, and there are a number of implementation issues to be resolved. In this work, we present a method for the rapid registration of RT3D US images of the beating heart to high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images. This method was validated using a volunteer image set. Validation results demonstrate that this approach can achieve rapid registration of images of the beating heart with fiducial landmark and registration errors of 1.25 {\textpm} 0.63 and 1.76 mm respectively. This technique can potentially be used to improve the diagnosis of cardiac disease by augmenting RT3D US images with high-resolution MR images and to facilitate intra-operative image fusion for minimally invasive cardio-thoracic surgical navigation.},

Methods and Results{\textemdash}Fifteen patients with atrial fibrillation refractory to medication underwent circumferential isolation of the pulmonary veins by using a novel catheter, with an ultrasound transducer (8-MHz) mounted near the tip, in a saline-filled balloon. Twelve atrial foci and/or atrial fibrillation triggers were identified in 9 patients (pulmonary vein locations: left upper, 3; right upper, 6; right middle, 1; right lower, 1; and left inferior, 1). In 5 patients, lesions were placed in the absence of any mapped triggers. Irrespective of trigger mapping, circumferential isolation of both upper pulmonary veins was attempted in all patients. The lower pulmonary veins were ablated when sinus rhythm activation mapping revealed evidence of a sleeve of atrial muscle in the vein. The median number of lesions per patient required to isolate 1 pulmonary vein was 4 (range, 1 to 29). After ablation, no evidence of narrowing was seen with repeat venography or follow-up computed tomography scan. After a mean follow-up of 35{\textpm}6 weeks, 5 patients had recurrence of atrial fibrillation. Three responded to drugs that were previously ineffective, and 2 remained in atrial fibrillation.

	abstract = {Objectives
We examined whether the presence and extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) predict adverse outcomes in nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) patients.
Background
Morbidity and mortality is high in NICM patients. However, the clinical course of an individual patient is unpredictable and current risk stratification approaches are limited. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance detects myocardial fibrosis, which appears as LGE after contrast administration and may convey prognostic importance.
Methods
In a prospective cohort study, 65 NICM patients with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction <=35\% underwent CMR before placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. The CMR images were analyzed for the presence and extent of LGE and for LV function, volumes, and mass. Patients were followed for an index composite end point of 3 cardiac events: hospitalization for heart failure, appropriate ICD firing, and cardiac death.
Results
A total of 42\% (n = 27) of patients had CMR LGE, averaging 10 {\textpm} 13\% of LV mass. During a 17-month median follow-up, 44\% (n = 12) of patients with LGE had an index composite outcome event versus only 8\% (n = 3) of those without LGE (p \&lt; 0.001 for Kaplan-Meier survival curves). After adjustment for LV volume index and functional class, patients with LGE had an 8-fold higher risk of experiencing the primary outcome (hazard ratio 8.2, 95\% confidence interval 2.2 to 30.9; p = 0.002).
Conclusions
A CMR LGE in NICM patients strongly predicts adverse cardiac outcomes. The CMR LGE may represent the end-organ consequences of sustained adrenergic activation and adverse LV remodeling, and its identification may significantly improve risk stratification strategies in this high risk population.

	abstract = {Background
This prospective multicenter randomized study aimed to compare the efficacy of 3 common ablation methods used for longstanding permanent atrial fibrillation (AF).
Methods
A total of 144 patients with longstanding permanent AF (median duration 28 months) were randomly assigned to circumferential pulmonary vein ablation (CPVA, group 1, n = 47), to pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI, group 2, n = 48) or to a hybrid strategy combining ablation of complex fractionated or rapid atrial electrograms (CFAE) in both atria followed by a pulmonary vein antrum isolation (CFAE + PVAI, group 3, n = 49).
Results
Scarring in the left atrium and structural heart disease/hypertension were present in most patients (65\%). After a mean follow-up of 16 months, 11\% of patients in group 1, 40\% of patients in group 2 and 61\% of patients in group 3 were in sinus rhythm after one procedure and with no antiarrhythmic drugs (P \&lt; .001). Sinus rhythm maintenance would increase respectively to 28\% (group 1), 83\% (group 2), and 94\% (group 3) after 2 procedures and with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs, P \&lt; .001). The AF terminated during ablation, either by conversion to sinus rhythm or organization into an atrial tachyarrhythmia, in 13\% of patients (group 1), 44\% (group 2), and 74\% (group 3) respectively. CFAE alone, performed as the first step of the ablation in group 3, organized AF in only 1 patient.
Conclusion
In this study, the hybrid AF ablation strategy including antrum isolation and CFAE ablation had the highest likelihood of maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with longstanding permanent AF. Electrical isolation of the PVs, although inadequate if performed alone, is relevant to achieve long-term sinus rhythm maintenance after ablation. Bi-atrial CFAE ablation had a minimal impact on AF termination during ablation.},

	abstract = {Background: The comparative effectiveness of treatments for atrial fibrillation (AF) is uncertain.Purpose: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of rate- and rhythm-control therapies.Data Sources: English-language studies in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between January 2000 and November 2013.Study Selection: Two reviewers independently screened citations to identify comparative studies that assessed rate- or rhythm-control therapies in patients with AF.Data Extraction: Reviewers extracted data on study design, participant characteristics, interventions, outcomes, applicability, and quality.Data Synthesis: 200 articles (162 studies) involving 28~836 patients were included. When pharmacologic rate- and rhythm-control strategies were compared, strength of evidence (SOE) was moderate supporting comparable efficacy with regard to all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.34 [95\% CI, 0.89 to 2.02]), cardiac mortality (OR, 0.96 [CI, 0.77 to 1.20]), and stroke (OR, 0.99 [CI, 0.76 to 1.30]) in older patients with mild AF symptoms. Few studies compared rate-control therapies and included outcomes of interest, which limited conclusions. For the effect of rhythm-control therapies in reducing AF recurrence, SOE was high favoring pulmonary vein isolation versus antiarrhythmic medications (OR, 5.87 [CI, 3.18 to 10.85]) and the surgical maze procedure (including pulmonary vein isolation) done during other cardiac surgery versus other cardiac surgery alone (OR, 7.94 [CI, 3.63 to 17.36]).Limitation: Studies were heterogeneous in interventions, populations, settings, and outcomes.Conclusion: Pharmacologic rate- and rhythm-control strategies have comparable efficacy across outcomes in primarily older patients with mild AF symptoms. Pulmonary vein isolation is better than antiarrhythmic medications at reducing recurrences of AF in younger patients with paroxysmal AF and mild structural heart disease. Future research should address uncertainties related to subgroups of interest and the effect of different therapies on long-term clinical outcomes.Primary Funding Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.},

Statistical analysis was only performed on studies that: (1) used a [greater than or equal to] 1.5 Tesla MR scanner; (2) employed invasive coronary angiography as the reference standard for diagnosing significant obstructive CAD, defined as a [greater than or equal to] 50\% diameter stenosis; and (3) provided sufficient data to permit analysis.RESULTS:From the 263 citations identified, 55 relevant original articles were selected. Only 35 fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria, and of these 26 presented data on patient-based analysis. The overall patient-based analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 89\% (95\% CI: 88-91\%), and a specificity of 80\% (95\% CI: 78-83\%). Adenosine stress perfusion CMR had better sensitivity than with dipyridamole (90\% (88-92\%) versus 86\% (80-90\%), P = 0.022), and a tendency to a better specificity (81\% (78-84\%) versus 77\% (71-82\%), P = 0.065).CONCLUSION:Stress perfusion CMR is highly sensitive for detection of CAD but its specificity remains moderate.},

The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

The lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was significantly decreased below the pre-exercise value for 2.5 days post-exercise (P less than 0.05). Residual volume (RV) showed a significantly increased value at 30 min of recovery (P less than 0.01) with no change in total lung capacity. There was no significant change in transthoracic electrical impedance following exercise but a decrease may have been masked by the increased RV. The changes in the pulmonary parameters may reflect the occurrence of a transient interstitial lung oedema. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction may be a part of the cardiopulmonary response as peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was significantly reduced at 30 min of recovery. The reason for the increase in pulmonary extravascular water volume may be a marked distension of the lung capillaries due to increased blood volume in the lungs and as a consequence increased vascular permeability. The changes may also be caused by impaired myocardial contractility indicated by a split impedance dZ/dt waveform, not previously described in healthy persons, which occurred in all six subjects immediately following exercise.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 3D PR SSFP sequence used projections in the x-y plane and partitions in z, providing 70-80 msec temporal resolution and 1.7 x 1.7 x 8-10 mm in a 24-heartbeat breath hold. A total of 10 volunteers were imaged with both methods, and the measurements of global cardiac function were compared. RESULTS: Mean signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for the blood and myocardium were 114 and 42 (2D) and 59 and 21 (3D). Bland-Altman analysis comparing the 2D and 3D ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end systolic volume (LVESV), and end diastolic myocardial mass (LVEDM) provided values of bias +/-2 SD of 0.6\% +/- 7.7 \% for LVEF, 5.9 mL +/- 20 mL for LVEDV, -2.8 mL +/- 12 mL for LVESV, and -0.61 g +/- 13 g for LVEDM. 3D interobserver variability was greater than 2D for LVEDM and LVESV. CONCLUSION: In a single breath hold, the 3D PR method provides comparable information to the standard 2D FT method, which employs 10-12 breath holds.},

We consider local rather than global image statistics and evolve a contour based on local information. Localized contours are capable of segmenting objects with heterogeneous feature profiles that would be difficult to capture correctly using a standard global method. The presented technique is versatile enough to be used with any global region-based active contour energy and instill in it the benefits of localization. We describe this framework and demonstrate the localization of three well-known energies in order to illustrate how our framework can be applied to any energy. We then compare each localized energy to its global counterpart to show the improvements that can be achieved. Next, an in-depth study of the behaviors of these energies in response to the degree of localization is given. Finally, we show results on challenging images to illustrate the robust and accurate segmentations that are possible with this new class of active contour models. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

Point landmarks have a unique position which can be deduced from the intensity variations in a sufficiently large neighborhood around the prominent point. We propose four 3D differential operators which are generalizations of existing 2D operators for detecting points of high intensity variations. In comparison to previous approaches, our operators have the advantage that only low order partial derivatives of the image function are necessary. Therefore, these operators are computationally efficient and do not suffer from instabilities of computing high order partial derivatives. We also describe how the 3D operators can be generalized to be used on images of arbitrary dimension. First experimental results will be presented on medical imagery.},

	abstract = {Background Despite the clinical importance of atrial fibrillation (AF), the development of chronic nonvalvular AF models has been difficult. Animal models of sustained AF have been developed primarily in the short-term setting. Recently, models of chronic ventricular myopathy and fibrillation have been developed after several weeks of continuous rapid ventricular pacing. We hypothesized that chronic rapid atrial pacing would lead to atrial myopathy, yielding a reproducible model of sustained AF.
Methods and Results Twenty-two halothane-anesthetized mongrel dogs underwent insertion of a transvenous lead at the right atrial appendage that was continuously paced at 400 beats per minute for 6 weeks. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 11 dogs to assess the effects of rapid atrial pacing on atrial size. Atrial vulnerability was defined as the ability to induce sustained repetitive atrial responses during programmed electrical stimulation and was assessed by extrastimulus and burst-pacing techniques. Effective refractory period (ERP) was measured at two endocardial sites in the right atrium. Sustained AF was defined as AF >=15 minutes. In animals with sustained AF, 10 quadripolar epicardial electrodes were surgically attached to the right and left atria. The local atrial fibrillatory cycle length (AFCL) was measured in a 20-second window, and the mean AFCL was measured at each site. Marked biatrial enlargement was documented; after 6 weeks of continuous rapid atrial pacing, the left atrium was 7.8{\textpm}1 cm2 at baseline versus 11.3{\textpm}1 cm2 after pacing, and the right atrium was 4.3{\textpm}0.7 cm2 at baseline versus 7.2{\textpm}1.3 cm2 after pacing. An increase in atrial area of at least 40\% was necessary to induce sustained AF and was strongly correlated with the inducibility of AF (r=.87). Electron microscopy of atrial tissue demonstrated structural changes that were characterized by an increase in mitochondrial size and number and by disruption of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. After 6 weeks of continuous rapid atrial pacing, sustained AF was induced in 18 dogs (82\%) and nonsustained AF was induced in 2 dogs (9\%). AF occurred spontaneously in 4 dogs (18\%). Right atrial ERP, measured at cycle lengths of 400 and 300 milliseconds at baseline, was significantly shortened after pacing, from 150{\textpm}8 to 127{\textpm}10 milliseconds and from 147{\textpm}11 to 123{\textpm}12 milliseconds, respectively (P{\textless}.001). This finding was highly predictive of inducibility of AF (90\%). Increased atrial area (40\%) and ERP shortening were highly predictive for the induction of sustained AF (88\%). Local epicardial ERP correlated well with local AFCL (R2=.93). Mean AFCL was significantly shorter in the left atrium (81{\textpm}8 milliseconds) compared with the right atrium 94{\textpm}9 milliseconds (P{\textless}.05). An area in the posterior left atrium was consistently found to have a shorter AFCL (74{\textpm}5 milliseconds). Cryoablation of this area was attempted in 11 dogs. In 9 dogs (82\%; mean, 9.0{\textpm}4.0; range, 5 to 14), AF was terminated and no longer induced after serial cryoablation.
Conclusions Sustained AF was readily inducible in most dogs (82\%) after rapid atrial pacing. This model was consistently associated with biatrial myopathy and marked changes in atrial vulnerability. An area in the posterior left atrium was uniformly shown to have the shortest AFCL. The results of restoration of sinus rhythm and prevention of inducibility of AF after cryoablation of this area of the left atrium suggest that this area may be critical in the maintenance of AF in this model.},

	abstract = {Although radiofrequency catheter ablation of the slow atrioventricular (AV) nodal pathway is highly effective for the management of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), this arrhythmia may recur in some patients after an ablation procedure that initially renders AVNRT noninducible. A retrospective study examined the factors that are associated with the recurrence of AVNRT after selective radiofrequency catheter ablation of the slow pathway. Patients were included in the study if they had initially inducible, typical slow-fast AVNRT that was noninducible at the end of the ablation session. Selective ablation of the slow pathway was performed using radiofrequency energy applied along the tricuspid annulus near the coronary sinus ostium. AVNRT recurred after initially successful slow pathway ablation in 10 of 136 patients (7.4\%) over a mean follow-up period of 20.1 {\textpm} 5.0 months; the time to recurrence ranged from 1 to 411 days. Despite the absence of inducible AVNRT, dual anterograde AV nodal conduction properties persisted after slow pathway ablation in 10 patients AVNRT recurred in 4 of 10 patients who had evidence of residual slow pathway conduction compared with only 6 of 126 who had no residual slow pathway conduction (p = 0.003). All patients with persistent slow pathway conduction and recurrent AVNRT also had residual AV nodal echo beats. AVNRT recurred in 3 of 6 patients without accelerated junctional tachycardia during radiofrequency application compared with only 7 of 109 with accelerated junctional tachycardia (p = 0.003). Thus, AVNRT infrequently recurs after successful selective radiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway. The presence of residual slow pathway conduction and AV nodal echo beats after ablation is associated with an increased risk of recurrent AVNRT.},

This study compared left atrial and left atrial appendage contraction velocities in sinus rhythm before and after a brief period of atrial fibrillation in a canine model.Background. In patients, left atrial appendage contraction velocities measured during sinus rhythm after cardioversion from atrial fibrillation are depressed relative to left atrial appendage emptying velocities measured during atrial fibrillation, suggesting that the left atrial appendage is mechanically {\textquotedblleft}stunned.{\textquotedblright}Methods. This phenomenon was studied in a canine model of acute (60 min) pacing-induced atrial fibrillation followed by spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm using epicardial and transesophageal pulsed wave Doppler. Unique features of the model include: 1) comparison of left atrial function postconversion to baseline sinus rhythm rather than to measurements during atrial fibrillation, 2) control of the duration of atrial fibrillation and 3) elimination of the extraneous influences of direct current shock and antiarrhythmic agents, which may independently depress left atrial function.Results. Hemodynamic conditions (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, mean pulmonary artery pressure, mean right atrial pressure and mean left atrial pressure) at baseline, during 60 min of atrial fibrillation and after reversion to sinus rhythm were constant throughout the study period. Peak left atrial contraction velocities (measured from the transmitral flow velocity profile) were significantly (p {\textless} 0.02) reduced to 64 {\textpm} 22\% of baseline values upon spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and recovered to basal values by 20 min after resumption of sinus rhythm. Peak left atrial appendage contraction velocities were significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) reduced to 49 {\textpm} 24\% of baseline values upon spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm and recovered to basal values by 40 min after reversion to sinus rhythm.Conclusions. Even brief (60 min) periods of atrial fibrillation in normal canine hearts result in marked depression of global left atrial systolic function and regional left atrial (left atrial appendage) systolic function upon resumption of sinus rhythm. This {\textquotedblleft}mechanical stunning{\textquotedblright} of left atrial systolic function appears to be more profound and of longer duration for the left atrial appendage compared with the left atrium as a whole, which may predispose the appendage to blood stasis and thrombus formation.

	abstract = {Objectives
The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the predictive value of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for future cardiovascular events and death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
Background
The utility of LGE for detecting myocardial fibrosis is well established. The prognostic value of LGE in HCM has been described in several studies, but controversy exists given the limited power of these studies to predict future events.
Methods
We searched multiple databases including PubMed for studies of LGE in HCM that reported selected clinical outcomes (cardiovascular mortality, sudden cardiac death [SCD], aborted SCD, and heart failure death). We performed a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis to determine pooled odds ratios for these clinical events.
Results
Four studies evaluated 1,063 patients over an average follow-up of 3.1 years. The pooled prevalence of LGE was 60\%. The pooled odds ratios (OR) demonstrate that LGE by CMR correlated with cardiac death (pooled OR: 2.92, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01 to 8.42; p = 0.047), heart failure death (pooled OR: 5.68, 95\% CI: 1.04 to 31.07; p = 0.045), and all-cause mortality (pooled OR: 4.46, 95\% CI: 1.53 to 13.01; p = 0.006), and showed a trend toward significance for predicting sudden death/aborted sudden death (pooled OR: 2.39, 95\% CI: 0.87 to 6.58; p = 0.091).
Conclusions
Late gadolinium enhancement by CMR has prognostic value in predicting adverse cardiovascular events among HCM patients. There are significant relationships between LGE and cardiovascular mortality, heart failure death, and all-cause mortality in HCM. Additionally, LGE and SCD/aborted SCD displayed a trend toward significance. The assessment of LGE by CMR has the potential to provide important information to improve risk stratification in HCM in clinical practice.},

If so, is f uniquely known from F and how can f be calculated? In Part B a solution of the dual problem of calculating a line function F(g) from its point mean values f(P) is solved in a certain sense. Finally, in Part C certain generalizations are discussed, prompted by consideration of non-Euclidean manifolds as well as higher dimensional spaces.

Venous blood sampled for coagulant proteins and markers of haemostatic activation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of left atrial thrombus and spontaneous echo contrast at transoesophageal echocardiography.

Patients with thrombus had increased plasma markers of platelet activation-beta thromboglobulin (56.8 v 30.4 IU/ml; P {\textless} 0.001) and platelet factor 4 (6.1 v 3.5 IU/ml; P {\textless} 0.01)-and of thrombogenesis: thrombin-antithrombin complexes (5.59 v 3.06 micrograms/ml; P {\textless} 0.001) and D-dimers (479 v 298 ng/ml; P {\textless} 0.01). von Willebrand factor was also increased (1.81 v 1.52 IU/ml; P {\textless} 0.05).

The roots of radiologic diagnostics go back to the European Renaissance. It is a history of medical pattern recognition and functional analysis by several methods including X-rays, ultrasound waves or strong magnetic fields. The difference between conventional radiographs and a picture reconstructed after digitalization, with several possibilities of postprocessing, is explained. Research and further technical revolutions, like the development of semiconductor elements and computers or tailored contrast media, sophisticated pictorial representations and perceptions, are among the cornerstones of imaging diagnostics. During this century many diseases have changed their manifestation and spread. This is illustrated by tuberculosis and cancer and highlights the growing importance of imaging diagnostics and interventional radiology. The thorny path to independence of radiology is also a history of the medical establishment's resistance.},

By calling these subroutines in an appropriate sequence, a user can cascade filters together to implement a desired filtering task on a single microprocessor. Included are an adaptive 60-Hz interference filter, two low-pass filters, a high-pass filter for eliminating dc offset in an ECG, an ECG data reduction algorithm, band-pass filters for use in QRS detection, and a derivative-based QRS detection algorithm. These filters achieve real-time speeds by requiring only integer arithmetic. They can be implemented on a diversity of available microprocessors.},

These changes consisted or proliferation of Z-band material and cytoskeletal filaments, myofibrillar loss, proliferation of elements of free and extended junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, variations in size and number of mitochondria, occurrence of abnormal mitochondria, dissociation of intercellular junctions, formation of spherical microparticles, and accumulation of lysosomal degradation products. Hypertrophy was considered to lead to cellular degeneration, with decrease or loss of contractile function. Atrial fibrillation was associated with severe cellular degeneration. The severity of degeneration was greater in patients with mitral regurgitation, with or without associated mitral stenosis, than in patients with pure mitral stenosis.},

The advent of 3.0 T magnets has allowed reduction in exogenous contrast dose without compromising overall image quality. The use of novel intravascular contrast agents substantially increases the image windows and decreases contrast dose. Additionally, the lower risk and cost in non-contrast enhanced (NCE) MRA has sparked renewed interest in these methods. This article discusses the current state of both contrast-enhanced (CE) and NCE-MRA. New CE-MRA methods take advantage of dose reduction at 3.0 T, novel contrast agents, and parallel imaging methods. The risks of gadolinium-based contrast media, and the NCE-MRA methods of time-of-flight, steady-state free precession, and phase contrast are discussed.},

One explanation for this gap, stereotype threat, was first proposed by Spencer, Steele, and Quinn (1999) and has received much attention. We discuss merits and shortcomings of this study and review replication attempts. Only 55\% of the articles with experimental designs that could have replicated the original results did so. But half of these were confounded by statistical adjustment of preexisting mathematics exam scores. Of the unconfounded experiments, only 30\% replicated the original. A meta-analysis of these effects confirmed that only the group of studies with adjusted mathematics scores displayed the stereotype threat effect. We conclude that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this as a mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics. We argue there are many reasons to close this gap, and that too much weight on the stereotype explanation may hamper research and implementation of effective interventions.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash}The pulmonary veins (PVs) and surrounding ostial areas frequently house focal triggers or reentrant circuits critical to the genesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). We developed an anatomic approach aimed at isolating each PV from the left atrium (LA) by circumferential radiofrequency (RF) lesions around their ostia.
Methods and Results{\textemdash}We selected 26 patients with resistant AF, either paroxysmal (n=14) or permanent (n=12). A nonfluoroscopic mapping system was used to generate 3D electroanatomic LA maps and deliver RF energy. Two maps were acquired during coronary sinus and right atrial pacing to validate the lateral and septal PV lesions, respectively. Patients were followed up closely for >=6 months. Procedures lasted 290{\textpm}58 minutes, including 80{\textpm}22 minutes for acquisition of all maps, and 118{\textpm}16 RF pulses were deployed. Among 14 patients in AF at the beginning of the procedure, 64\% had sinus rhythm restoration during ablation. PV isolation was demonstrated in 76\% of 104 PVs treated by low peak-to-peak electrogram amplitude (0.08{\textpm}0.02 mV) inside the circular line and by disparity in activation times (58{\textpm}11 ms) across the lesion. After 9{\textpm}3 months, 22 patients (85\%) were AF-free, including 62\% not taking and 23\% taking antiarrhythmic drugs, with no difference (P=NS) between paroxysmal and permanent AF. No thromboembolic events or PV stenoses were observed by transesophageal echocardiography.
Conclusions{\textemdash}Radiofrequency PV isolation with electroanatomic guidance is safe and effective in either paroxysmal or permanent AF.},

	abstract = {We present a new multiscale approach for deformable contour optimization. The method relies on a multigrid minimization method and a coarse-to-fine relaxation algorithm. This approach consists in minimizing a cascade of optimization problems of reduced and increasing complexity instead of considering the minimization problem on the full and original configuration space. Contrary to classical multiresolution algorithms, no reduction of image is applied. The family of defined energy functions are derived from the original (full resolution) objective function, ensuring that the same function is handled at each scale and that the energy decreases at each step of the deformable contour minimization process. The efficiency and the speed of this multiscale optimization strategy is demonstrated in the difficult context of the minimization of a region-based contour energy function ensuring the boundary detection of anatomical structures in ultrasound medical imagery. In this context, the proposed multiscale segmentation method is compared to other classical region-based segmentation approaches such as Maximum Likelihood or Markov Random Field-based segmentation techniques. We also extend this multiscale segmentation strategy to active contour models using a classical edge-based likelihood approach. Finally, time and performance analysis of this approach, compared to the (commonly used) dynamic programming-based optimization procedure, is given and allows to attest the accuracy and the speed of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY: Biopsies of the posterior wall of the left atrium were obtained from 44 patients undergoing mitral surgery for mitral valvular disease, and the specimens were graded according to severity of morphologic change. In grade I the atrial myocardium is essentially normal; grade II patients show moderate to severe fibrosis and preservation of muscle mass and architecture; grade III patients show extensive fibrosis, a loss of muscle mass, and disruption of architecture. The pathological grading was compared with such clinical parameters as type of valvular lesion, rhythm before surgery, and degree of left atrial enlargement. Cardioversion was attempted after surgery whenever feasible. Nine patients were successfully cardioverted, and all had grade II changes. Three additional patients succeeded and then relapsed; one had grade II and two had grade III changes. In seven patients cardioversion failed, and six of these had grade III changes. The one exception was a patient in grade I who had a cardiomyopathy. We propose that fibrosis after rheumatic inflammatory insults leads to atrial fibrillation by disturbing impulse propagation in the atrium; prolonged atrial fibrillation leads to a disuse atrophy of muscle, and atrial fibrillation becomes irreversible. These pathologic changes may be used for predicting success or failure of cardioversion and probability of maintaining sinus rhythm.},

	title = {Effect of atrial fibrillation on the dynamics of mitral annular area},
	volume = {12},
	issn = {0966-8519},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: The mitral annulus shows dynamic changes in shape and size during the cardiac cycle. A smaller size in end-diastole is attributed to the sphincteric action of atrial systole, and this may be important for functional integrity of the mitral valve. However, the effect of atrial fibrillation (AF) on dynamic changes in mitral annular size in humans is not known.
METHODS: Mitral annular diameters in apical four- and two-chamber views were measured using echocardiography in 25 patients in atrial fibrillation, and in 37 subjects in normal sinus rhythm at mid-diastole, end-diastole and end-systole. Mitral annular area was computed assuming elliptical geometry.
RESULTS: Patients in sinus rhythm showed a significant increase in mitral annular area of 25.9 +/- 12.8\% with ventricular systole compared to its area in end-diastole (p {\textless} 0.0001), and a 10.5 +/- 8.4\% reduction with atrial systole compared to mid-diastole (p {\textless} 0.001). Patients in AF had larger mitral annuli which showed non-significant changes in size between these three phases of the cardiac cycle. Percent reduction in mitral annular area in the latter half of diastole correlated significantly with left atrial (LA) diameter (r = -0.54, p {\textless} 0.0001), LA volume (r = -0.50, p {\textless} 0.0001), left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening (r = 0.37, p = 0.0036), mitral annular area in mid-diastole (r = -0.41, p = 0.0011) and mitral annular area in end-diastole (r = -0.64, p {\textless} 0.0001). That is, atrial sphincteric action on the mitral annulus was less in the presence of larger left atrium or the mitral annulus. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed rhythm and mitral annular size to be independent predictors of dynamic changes in mitral annular area.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that AF blunts or eliminates the phasic changes in mitral annular size during the cardiac cycle with loss of its presystolic sphincteric action; this may have implications in the genesis and surgical correction of mitral regurgitation.},

Most antibiotics were produced by screening soil microorganisms, but this limited resource of cultivable bacteria was overmined by the 1960s. Synthetic approaches to produce antibiotics have been unable to replace this platform. Uncultured bacteria make up approximately 99\% of all species in external environments, and are an untapped source of new antibiotics. We developed several methods to grow uncultured organisms by cultivation in situ or by using specific growth factors. Here we report a new antibiotic that we term teixobactin, discovered in a screen of uncultured bacteria. Teixobactin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to a highly conserved motif of lipid II (precursor of peptidoglycan) and lipid III (precursor of cell wall teichoic acid). We did not obtain any mutants of Staphylococcus aureus or Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to teixobactin. The properties of this compound suggest a path towards developing antibiotics that are likely to avoid development of resistance.},

A possible cause may be the absence of spatial information in the measure. The present paper proposes to include spatial information by combining mutual information with a term based on the image gradient of the images to be registered. The gradient term not only seeks to align locations of high gradient magnitude, but also aims for a similar orientation of the gradients at these locations. Results of combining both standard mutual information as well a normalized measure are presented for rigid registration of three-dimensional clinical images (MR, CT and PET). The results indicate that the combined measures yield a better registration function than mutual information or normalized mutual information per se. The accuracy of the combined measures is compared against a screw marker based gold standard, revealing a similar accuracy for the combined measures to that of the standard measures. Experiments into the robustness of the measures with respect to starting position imply a clear improvement in robustness for the measures including spatial information.},

Such imaging is still in its infancy, particularly in comparison to structural imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), x-ray computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound. We present an overview of noninvasive ECG imaging, and the challenges and successes of the various techniques across a range of applications. Unlike MRI and CT, reconstructing cardiac electrophysiology from remote body surface measurements is a highly ill-posed problem. We therefore first review the theoretical considerations and associated algorithms that are used to address this issue. We then focus on the important issue of validation, and review and contrast recent advances in this area. Efforts to validate ECG inverse procedures using a modeling-based approach are addressed first. We then discuss various experimental studies that have been conducted to provide appropriate data for robust validations. We present new data that are simultaneously recorded from dense arrays of electrodes on the epicardium and body surface of anesthetized pigs during sinus rhythm, ventricular pacing, and regional ischemia. These data have been obtained specifically to help validate inverse ECG procedures, and form a useful supplement to recent clinical validation studies. Finally, clinical applications and outstanding issues regarding noninvasive imaging of regional cardiac electrophysiology are addressed.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash} The purpose of this study was to provide an updated worldwide report on the methods, efficacy, and safety of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF).Methods and Results{\textemdash} A questionnaire with 46 questions was sent to 521 centers from 24 countries in 4 continents. Complete interviews were collected from 182 centers, of which 85 reported to have performed 20 825 catheter ablation procedures on 16 309 patients with AF between 2003 and 2006. The median number of procedures per center was 245 (range, 2 to 2715). All centers included paroxysmal AF, 85.9\% also included persistent and 47.1\% also included long-lasting AF. Carto-guided left atrial circumferential ablation (48.2\% of patients) and Lasso-guided ostial electric disconnection (27.4\%) were the most commonly used techniques. Efficacy data were analyzed with centers representing the unit of analysis. Of 16 309 patients with full disclosure of outcome data, 10 488 (median, 70.0\%; interquartile range, 57.7\% to 75.4\%) became asymptomatic without antiarrhythmic drugs and another 2047 (10.0\%; 0.5\% to 17.1\%) became asymptomatic in the presence of previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs over 18 (range, 3 to 24) months of follow-up. Success rates free of antiarrhythmic drugs and overall success rates were significantly larger in 9590 patients with paroxysmal AF (74.9\% and 83.2\%) than in 2800 patients with persistent AF (64.8\% and 75.0\%) and 1108 patients with long-lasting AF (63.1\% and 72.3\%) (P{\textless}0.0001). Major complications were reported in 741 patients (4.5\%).Conclusions{\textemdash} When analyzed in a large number of electrophysiology laboratories worldwide, catheter ablation of AF shows to be effective in ?80\% of patients after 1.3 procedures per patient, with ?70\% of them not requiring further antiarrhythmic drugs during intermediate follow-up.},

	abstract = {The manipulation of fast moving, delicate tissues in beating heart procedures presents a considerable challenge to surgeons. We present a new robotic force stabilization system that assists surgeons by maintaining a constant contact force with the beating heart. The system incorporates a novel, miniature uniaxial force sensor that is mounted to surgical instrumentation to measure contact forces during surgical manipulation. Using this sensor in conjunction with real-time tissue motion information derived from 3D ultrasound, we show that a force controller with feed-forward motion terms can provide safe and accurate force stabilization in an in vivo contact task against the beating mitral valve annulus. This confers a 50\% reduction in force fluctuations when compared to a standard force controller and a 75\% reduction in fluctuations when compared to manual attempts to maintain the same force.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

Targets for radiofrequency (RF) ablation of atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and nonidiopathic ventricular tachycardia are increasingly being selected on the basis of anatomic considerations. Because fluoroscopy provides only limited information about the relationship between catheter positions and cardiac structures and is associated with radiation risk, other approaches to mapping may be beneficial.


METHODS AND RESULTS

An electromagnetic catheter positioning system was superimposed on 3D MR images using fiducial markers. This allowed the dynamic display of the catheter position on the true anatomy of previously acquired MR images in real time. In vitro accuracy and precision during catheter navigation were assessed in a phantom model and were 1.11+/-0.06 and 0.30+/-0.07 mm (mean+/-SEM), respectively. Left and right heart catheterization was performed in 7 swine without the use of fluoroscopy, yielding an in vivo accuracy and precision of 2.74+/-0.52 and 1.97+/-0.44 mm, respectively. To assess the reproducibility of RF ablation, RF lesions were created repeatedly at the identical anatomic site in the right atrium (n=8 swine). Average distance of the repeated right atrial ablations was 3.92+/-0.5 mm. Straight 3-point lines were created in the right and left ventricles to determine the ability to facilitate complex ablation procedures (n=6 swine). The ventricular lesions deviated 1.70+/-0.24 mm from a straight line, and the point distance differed by 2.25+/-0.63 mm from the pathological specimen.


CONCLUSIONS

Real-time display of the catheter position on 3D MRI allows accurate and precise RF ablation guided by the true anatomy. This may facilitate anatomically based ablation procedures in, for instance, atrial fibrillation or nonidiopathic ventricular tachycardia and decrease radiation times.},

	abstract = {Background Atrial fibrillation is usually thought to be due to multiple circulating reentrant wavelets. From previous studies, a focal mechanism is considered to be very unlikely. In this report, focal atrial fibrillation is defined on an ECG pattern of atrial fibrillation and later demonstrated to be due to a focal source. Methods and Results Nine patients (five men and four women; age, 38\{+/-\}7 years) with paroxysmal focal atrial fibrillation are reported here. All were free of structural heart disease and had frequent episodes of atrial fibrillation despite the use of a mean of 4\{+/-\}2 antiarrhythmic drugs. Atrial fibrillation was associated with runs of irregular atrial tachycardia or monomorphic extrasystoles. The electrophysiological study demonstrated that all the atrial arrhythmias were due to the same focus firing irregularly and exhibiting a consistent and centrifugal pattern of activation. Three foci were found to be located in the right atrium, two near the sinus node and one in the ostium of the coronary sinus. Six others were located in the left atrium at the ostium of the right pulmonary veins (n=5) and at the ostium of the left superior pulmonary vein (n=1). All atrial arrhythmias were successfully treated by use of a mean of 4\{+/-\}4 radiofrequency pulses. Conclusions In some patients, the surface ECG pattern of atrial fibrillation is due to a focal rapidly firing source of activity that can be eliminated by discrete radiofrequency energy applications.},

Registration is achieved by adjustment of the relative position and orientation until the mutual information between the images is maximized. In our derivation of the registration procedure, few assumptions are made about the nature of the imaging process. As a result the algorithms are quite general and can foreseeably be used with a wide variety of imaging devices. This approach works directly with image data; no pre-processing or segmentation is required. This technique is, however, more flexible and robust than other intensity-based techniques like correlation. Additionally, it has an efficient implementation that is based on stochastic approximation. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the approach registering magnetic resonance (MR) images with computed tomography (CT) images, and with positron-emission tomography (PET) images. Surgical applications of the registration method are described.},

The properties and detection of the magnetisation due to hydrogen protons are outlined, and a rotating frame is introduced to describe the motion of the magnetisation. Radiofrequency (RF) pulses are used to rotate the magnetisation, and slice selection is achieved using a 90 degree RF pulse and a magnetic field gradient. Data acquisition and image reconstruction are explained. Three scanning sequences are described: repeated free induction decay (FID), inversion - recovery, and spin-echo. These sequences produce images whose pixel values have different dependencies on hydrogen proton density, T1 and T2. Inversion-recovery images show striking differentiation between grey and white matter in the brain. The absence of bone artifact is a significant advantage over X-ray computed tomography in the posterior fossa, where rapid repeated FID sequences can also be used to demonstrate flow effects. The considerable soft tissue contrast available with NMR is of value in demonstrating disease within the liver where T1 appears to be sensitive but relatively nonspecific diagnostic parameter. High resolution scans are of value in demonstrating the adrenal gland and spinal cord.},

	abstract = {Real-time three-dimensional (RT3D) echocardiography is a new image acquisition technique that allows instantaneous acquisition of volumetric images for quantitative assessment of cardiac morphology and function. To quantify many important diagnostic parameters, such as ventricular volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output, an automatic algorithm to delineate the left ventricle (LV) from RT3D echocardiographic images is essential. While a number of efforts have been made towards segmentation of the LV endocardial (ENDO) boundaries, the segmentation of epicardial (EPI) boundaries remains problematic. In this paper, we present a coupled deformable model that addresses this problem. The idea behind our method is that the volume of the myocardium is close to being constant during a cardiac cycle and our model uses this coupling as an important constraint. We employ two surfaces, each driven by the image-derived information that takes into account ultrasound physics by modeling the speckle statistics using the Nakagami distribution while maintaining the coupling. By simultaneously evolving two surfaces, the final segmentation of the myocardium is thus achieved. Results from 80 sets of synthetic data and 286 sets of real canine data were evaluated against the ground truth and against outlines from three independent observers, respectively. We show that results obtained with our incompressibility constraint were more accurate than those obtained without constraint or with a wall thickness constraint, and were comparable to those from manual segmentation.},

	abstract = {Electrical cardioversion of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is frequently performed to relieve symptoms and improve cardiac performance. Patients undergoing cardioversion are treated conventionally with therapeutic anticoagulation for three weeks before and four weeks after cardioversion to decrease the risk of thromboembolism. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided strategy has been proposed as an alternative that may lower stroke and bleeding events. Patients without atrial cavity thrombus or atrial appendage thrombus by TEE are cardioverted on achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation, whereas cardioversion is delayed in higher risk patients with thrombus. The aim of this review is to discuss the issues and controversies associated with the management of patients with AF undergoing cardioversion. We provide an overview of the TEE-guided and conventional anticoagulation strategies in light of the recently completed Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography (ACUTE) clinical trial. The two management strategies comparably lower the patient{\textquoteright}s embolic risk when the guidelines are properly followed. The TEE-guided strategy with shorter term anticoagulation may lower the incidence of bleeding complications and safely expedite early cardioversion. The inherent advantages and disadvantages of both strategies are presented. The TEE-guided approach with short-term anticoagulation is considered to be a safe and clinically effective alternative to the conventional approach, and it is advocated in patients in whom earlier cardioversion would be clinically beneficial.},

A 9F 64 electrode balloon catheter and a conventional 7F electrode catheter for mapping and ablation were positioned in the LV using a retrograde aortic approach. Using a boundary element inverse solution, 3,360 virtual endocardial electrograms were computed and used to derive isopotential maps. An incorporated locator system was used in conjunction with or instead of fluoroscopy to position the conventional electrode catheter.RESULTSA total of 21 VTs, 12 of which were hemodynamically-tolerated and 9 of which were not, were mapped. Isolated diastolic potentials, presystolic areas, zones of slow conduction and exit sites during VT were identified using virtual electrograms and isopotential maps. Among 19 targeted VTs, radiofrequency ablation guided by the computerized mapping system and the locator signal was successful in 15.CONCLUSIONSThe computerized mapping system described in this study computes accurate isopotential maps that are a useful guide for ablation of hemodynamically stable or unstable VT.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: As a stand-alone imaging modality, two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound (US) can only guide basic interventional tasks due to the limited spatial orientation information contained in these images. High-resolution real-time three-dimensional (3D) US can potentially overcome this limitation, thereby expanding the applications for US-guided procedures to include intracardiac surgery and fetal surgery, while potentially improving results of solid organ interventions such as image-guided breast, liver or prostate procedures. The following study examines the benefits of real-time 3D US for performing both basic and complex image-guided surgical tasks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven surgical trainees performed three tasks in an acoustic testing tank simulating an image-guided surgical environment using 2D US, biplanar 2D US, and 3D US for guidance. Surgeon-controlled US imaging was also tested. The evaluation tasks were (1) bead-in-hole navigation; (2) bead-to-bead navigation; and (3) clip fixation. Performance measures included completion time, tool tip trajectory, and error rates, with endoscope-guided performance serving as a gold-standard reference measure for each subject. RESULTS: Compared to 2D US guidance, completion times decreased significantly with 3D US for both bead-in-hole navigation (50\%, p = 0.046) and bead-to-bead navigation (77\%, p = 0.009). Furthermore, tool-tip tracking for bead-to-bead navigation demonstrated improved navigational accuracy using 3D US versus 2D US (46\%, p = 0.040). Biplanar 2D imaging and surgeon-controlled 2D US did not significantly improve performance as compared to conventional 2D US. In real-time 3D mode, surgeon-controlled imaging and changes in 3D image presentation made by adjusting the perspective of the 3D image did not diminish performance. For clip fixation, completion times proved excessive with 2D US guidance ({\textgreater} 240 s). However, with real-time 3D US imaging, completion times and error rates were comparable to endoscope-guided performance. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time 3D US can guide basic surgical tasks more efficiently and accurately than 2D US imaging. Real-time 3D US can also guide more complex surgical tasks which may prove useful for procedures where optical imaging is suboptimal, as in fetal surgery or intracardiac interventions.},

After a His bundle potential had been recorded, a synchronized direct-current electrical discharge was delivered between the electrodes showing the largest His bundle deflection using a standard direct-current defibrillator, and a metallic plate was positioned over the dog's back. Complete atrioventricular (AV) block was induced in 9 of 10 dogs, which were followed for 3 mo before being killed. During AV block, the QRS complex was broad and not preceded by a His bundle deflection. The mean control cycle length during AV block was 1,441 +/- 223 ms and decreased to 1,151 +/- 181 ms after exercise, a response that was usually abolished by beta-blockade. Overdrive pacing resulted in pacemaker suppression with gradual rate stabilization after 10-20 beats. There was no evidence of myocardial or valvular damage. This technique provides for a stable model of complete AV block and is suitable for experiments in which heart rate control is required. In addition, this technique may be of value for patients with tachycardia requiring His bundle section.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES

We sought to evaluate whether a limited surgical cryoablation of the posterior region of the left atrium was safe and effective in the cure of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with associated valvular heart disease.

BACKGROUND

Extensive surgical ablation of AF is a complex and risky procedure. The posterior region of the left atrium seems to be important in the initiation and maintenance of AF.

METHODS

In 32 patients with chronic AF who underwent heart valve surgery, linear cryolesions connecting the four pulmonary veins and the posterior mitral annulus were performed. Eighteen patients with AF who underwent valvular surgery but refused cryoablation were considered as the control group.

RESULTS

Sinus rhythm (SR) was restored in 25 (78\%) of 32 patients immediately after the operation. The cryoablation procedure required 20 {\textpm} 4 min. There were no intraoperative and perioperative complications. During the hospital period, one patient died of septicemia. Thirty-one patients reached a minimum of nine months of follow-up. Two deaths occurred but were unrelated to the procedure. Twenty (69\%) of 29 patients remained in SR with cryoablation alone, and 26 (90\%) of 29 patients with cryoablation, drugs and radiofrequency ablation. Three (10\%) of 29 patients remained in chronic AF. Right and left atrial contractility was evident in 24 (92\%) of 26 patients in SR. In control group, two deaths occurred, and SR was present in only four (25\%) of 16 patients.

CONCLUSIONS

Linear cryoablation with lesions connecting the four pulmonary veins and the mitral annulus is effective in restoration and maintenance of SR in patients with heart valve disease and chronic AF. Limited left atrial cryoablation may represent a valid alternative to the maze procedure, reducing myocardial ischemic time and risk of bleeding.},

The accuracy of the similarity measures are compared to a "gold-standard" registration which has been accurately calculated using fiducial markers. The similarity measures are used to register a computed tomography (CT) scan of a spine phantom to a fluoroscopy image of the phantom. The registration is carried out within a region-of-interest in the fluoroscopy image which is user defined to contain a single vertebra. Many of the problems involved in this type of registration are caused by features which were not modeled by a phantom image alone. More realistic "gold-standard" data sets were simulated using the phantom image with clinical image features overlaid. Results show that the introduction of soft-tissue structures and interventional instruments into the phantom image can have a large effect on the performance of some similarity measures previously applied to 2-D-3-D image registration. Two measures were able to register accurately and robustly even when soft-tissue structures and interventional instruments were present as differences between the images. These measures were pattern intensity and gradient difference. Their registration accuracy, for all the rigid-body parameters except for the source to film translation, was within a root-mean-square (rms) error of 0.53 mm or degrees to the "gold-standard" values. No failures occurred while registering using these measures.},

However, observational data increasingly suggest that patients suffering from congestive heart failure in presence of modest QRS widening may also derive benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and that some patients can be significantly improved clinically after system implantation despite no apparent change in QRS width. This pilot study explored the value of an echocardiographic model to identify cardiac electromechanical dyssynchrony parameters (EDP) in candidates for CRT, and their potential correction after implantation. The study included 66 consecutive CRT recipients of CRT in NYHA functional class III or IV who had one or more atrioventricular, interventricular or intraventricular dyssynchrony criteria. An immediate improvement was observed in 85\% of the population with a partial or total correction of their EDP. However, the modifications in EDP differed considerably between recipients of de novo CRT systems and patients with previously implanted standard pacing systems upgraded with the implantation of a left ventricular lead. EDP measurements appear to identify potential candidates for CRT, and to confirm the success of system implantation. (PACE 2003; 26[Pt. II]:137{\textendash}143)},

	abstract = {Objective: To examine the hypothesis that major extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are expressed differently in the left atrial tissue of patients in sinus rhythm (SR), lone atrial fibrillation (AF), and AF with underlying mitral valve disease (MVD)., Design: Case-control study., Patients: 118 patients with lone AF, MVD+AF, and SR., Main outcome measures: Collagen I, collagen III, and fibronectin protein expression measured by quantitative western blotting techniques and immunohistochemical methods., Results: Protein concentrations increased in patients with AF (all forms) compared with those in SR (all forms): collagen I (1.15 (0.11) v 0.45 (0.28), respectively; p ?=? 0.002), collagen III (0.74 (0.05) v 0.46 (0.11); p ?=? 0.002, and fibronectin (0.88 (0.06) v 0.62 (0.13); p ?=? 0.08). Especially, collagen I was similarly enhanced in both lone AF (1.49 (0.15) and MVD+AF (1.53 (0.16) compared with SR (0.56 (0.28); both p ?=? 0.01). Collagen III was not significantly increased in lone AF but was significantly increased in AF combined with MVD (0.84 (0.07) both compared with SR (0.46 (0.11); p ?=? 0.01). The concentration of fibronectin was not significantly increased in lone AF and MVD+AF (both compared with SR). Furthermore, there was a similar degree of enhanced collagen expression in paroxysmal AF and chronic AF., Conclusions: AF is associated with fibrosis. Forms of AF differ from each other in collagen III expression. However, there was no systematic difference in ECM expression between paroxysmal AF and chronic AF. Enhanced concentrations of ECM proteins may have a role in structural remodelling and the pathogenesis of AF as a result of separation of the cells by fibrotic depositions.},

	abstract = {Introduction:  Amiodarone is the most widely used antiarrhythmic agent, with demonstrated effectiveness against all the spectrum of cardiac tachyarrhythmias. The risk of adverse effects acts as a limiting factor to its utilization especially in the long term. This article systematically reviews the published evidence on amiodarone versus placebo to examine its safety as an antiarrhythmic drug.   Areas covered:  Authors collected data on adverse effects reported in 49 randomized placebo-controlled trials with amiodarone. Adverse effects were classified according to the organ/system involved. Pooled estimates of the number needed to treat (NNT) and to harm (NNH) versus placebo were calculated.   Expert opinion:  Amiodarone is effective for both the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) (11 trials, NNT = 4 at 24 h; p = 0.003) and the prevention of postoperative AF (18 trials, NNT = 8; p {\textless} 0.001), although with an increased risk of bradycardia, hypotension, nausea or phlebitis (pooled NNH = 4; p {\textless} 0.001). Amiodarone administration for the maintenance of sinus rhythm has a favorable net clinical benefit (pooled NNT = 3; p {\textless} 0.001 versus pooled NNH for either thyroid toxicity, gastrointestinal discomfort, skin toxicity or eye toxicity = 11; p {\textless} 0.001). Treatment with amiodarone for the prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death has less favorable net clinical benefit (15 trials, NNT = 38; p {\textless} 0.001 versus NNH for either thyroid toxicity, hepatic toxicity, pulmonary toxicity or bradycardia = 14; p {\textless} 0.001). Amiodarone treatment in this setting should be used in only selected cases.},

In patients, the segmented turboFLASH technique was used to acquire contrast material{\textendash}enhanced images 19 days~{\textpm}~7 (SD) after myocardial infarction. RESULTS: Myocardial regions of increased signal intensity were observed in all animals and patients at imaging. With the postcontrast segmented turboFLASH sequence, the signal intensity of the infarcted myocardium was 1,080\%~{\textpm}~214 higher than that of the normal myocardium in dogs{\textemdash}nearly twice that of the next best sequence tested and approximately 10-fold greater than that in previous reports. All 18 patients with myocardial infarction demonstrated high signal intensity at imaging. On average, the signal intensity of the high-signal-intensity regions in patients was 485\%~{\textpm}~43 higher than that of the normal myocardium. CONCLUSION: The segmented inversion-recovery turboFLASH sequence produced the greatest differences in regional myocardial signal intensity in animals. Application of this technique in patients with infarction substantially improved differentiation between injured and normal regions.},

	abstract = {Background
The reported complication rate of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) varies.
Objective
Our goal was to assess temporal trends and the effect of both institutional and individual operators' experience on the incidence of complications.
Methods
All patients undergoing AF ablation at Johns Hopkins Hospital between February 2001 and December 2010 were prospectively enrolled in a database. Major complications were defined as those that were life-threatening, resulted in permanent harm, required intervention, or significantly prolonged hospitalization.
Results
Fifty-six major complications occurred in 1190 procedures (4.7\%). The majority of complications were vascular (18; 1.5\%), followed by pericardial tamponade (13; 1.1\%) and cerebrovascular accident (12; 1.1\%). No cases of death or atrioesophageal fistula occurred. The overall complication rate decreased from 11.1\% in 2002 to 1.6\% in 2010 (P \&lt;.05). On univariate analysis, demographic and clinical factors associated with the increased risk of complications were CHADS2 score of >=2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.5; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4{\textendash}4.4; P = .002), female gender (HR = 2.0; 95\% CI = 1.2{\textendash}3.5; P = .014), and age (HR = 1.03; 95\% CI = 1.0{\textendash}1.1; P = .042). Gender and CHADS2 score of >=2 remained independent predictors of complication on multivariable analysis.
Conclusion
The complication rate of catheter ablation of AF decreased with increased institutional experience. Female gender and CHADS2 score of >=2 are significant independent risk factors for complications and should be considered when referring patients for AF ablation.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD010813.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combined oral contraceptive (COC) use has been associated with venous thrombosis (VT) (i.e., deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism). The VT risk has been evaluated for many estrogen doses and progestagen types contained in COC but no comprehensive comparison involving commonly used COC is available.
OBJECTIVES: To provide a comprehensive overview of the risk of venous thrombosis in women using different combined oral contraceptives.
SEARCH METHODS: Electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier and ScienceDirect) were searched in 22 April 2013 for eligible studies, without language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected studies including healthy women taking COC with VT as outcome.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome of interest was a fatal or non-fatal first event of venous thrombosis with the main focus on deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Publications with at least 10 events in total were eligible. The network meta-analysis was performed using an extension of frequentist random effects models for mixed multiple treatment comparisons. Unadjusted relative risks with 95\% confidence intervals were reported.Two independent reviewers extracted data from selected studies.
MAIN RESULTS: 3110 publications were retrieved through a search strategy; 25 publications reporting on 26 studies were included. Incidence of venous thrombosis in non-users from two included cohorts was 0.19 and 0.37 per 1 000 person years, in line with previously reported incidences of 0,16 per 1 000 person years. Use of combined oral contraceptives increased the risk of venous thrombosis compared with non-use (relative risk 3.5, 95\% confidence interval 2.9 to 4.3). The relative risk of venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with 30-35 $\mu$g ethinylestradiol and gestodene, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate, or drospirenone were similar and about 50-80\% higher than for combined oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel. A dose related effect of ethinylestradiol was observed for gestodene, desogestrel, and levonorgestrel, with higher doses being associated with higher thrombosis risk.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: All combined oral contraceptives investigated in this analysis were associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. The effect size depended both on the progestogen used and the dose of ethinylestradiol. Risk of venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with 30-35 $\mu$g ethinylestradiol and gestodene, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate and drospirenone were similar, and about 50-80\% higher than with levonorgestrel. The combined oral contraceptive with the lowest possible dose of ethinylestradiol and good compliance should be prescribed-that is, 30 $\mu$g ethinylestradiol with levonorgestrel.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Integration of preprocedural delayed enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) with electroanatomical voltage mapping (EAVM) may provide additional high-resolution substrate information for catheter ablation of scar-related ventricular tachycardias (VT). Accurate and fast image integration of DE-MRI with EAVM is desirable for MR-guided ablation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-six VT patients with large transmural scar underwent catheter ablation and preprocedural DE-MRI. With different registration models and EAVM input, 3 image integration methods were evaluated and compared to the commercial registration module CartoMerge. The performance was evaluated both in terms of distance measure that describes surface matching, and correlation measure that describes actual scar correspondence. Compared to CartoMerge, the method that uses the translation-and-rotation model and high-density EAVM input resulted in a registration error of 4.32{\textpm}0.69 mm as compared to 4.84 {\textpm} 1.07 (P {\textless}0.05); the method that uses the translation model and high-density EAVM input resulted in a registration error of 4.60 {\textpm} 0.65 mm (P = NS); and the method that uses the translation model and a single anatomical landmark input resulted in a registration error of 6.58 {\textpm} 1.63 mm (P {\textless} 0.05). No significant difference in scar correlation was observed between all 3 methods and CartoMerge (P = NS).
CONCLUSIONS: During VT ablation procedures, accurate integration of EAVM and DE-MRI can be achieved using a translation registration model and a single anatomical landmark. This model allows for image integration in minimal mapping time and is likely to reduce fluoroscopy time and increase procedure efficacy.},

	abstract = {The cardiovascular imaging field has experienced marked growth and technical advancement in the past several decades. In the future, multimodality imaging will provide enhanced characterisation of disease states. Myocardial perfusion imaging will become more quantitative, permitting measurement of absolute blood flow and coronary flow reserves during stress states. A greater use of positron emission tomography (PET) can be expected for both assessing blood flow quantitatively and molecular imaging of atherosclerotic plaques and myocardial disease states. SPECT and PET imaging of myocardial metabolism and cardiac neuronal imaging have already shown great promise for identifying high-risk patients with coronary heart disease and nonischaemic cardiomyopathy. Further progress will occur in computed tomography imaging of the heart and coronary arteries and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging including quantitative estimates of coronary blood flow, coronary and peripheral vessel plaque characterisation, and detection of myocardial cellular dysfunction. Fusion imaging, in which two disparate image data sets are merged into one functional image, will become commonplace. Major breakthroughs in CV imaging will depend on discoveries in basic research, further refinement of instrumentation and software for image processing and analysis, and outcomes research demonstrating the worth of imaging technologies in reducing cardiovascular death and morbidity.},

	abstract = {The left atrial appendage (LAA) is derived from the left wall of the primary atrium, which forms during the fourth week of embryonic development. It has developmental, ultrastructural, and physiological characteristics distinct from the left atrium proper. The LAA lies within the confines of the pericardium in close relation to the free wall of the left ventricle and thus its emptying and filling may be significantly affected by left ventricular function. The physiological properties and anatomical relations of the LAA render it ideally suited to function as a decompression chamber during left ventricular systole and during other periods when left atrial pressure is high. These properties include the position of the LAA high in the body of the left atrium; the increased distensibility of the LAA compared with the left atrium proper; the high concentration of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) granules contained within the LAA; and the neuronal configuration of the LAA. Thrombus has a predilection to form in the LAA in patients with atrial fibrillation, mitral valve disease, and other conditions. The pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated; however, relative stasis which occurs in the appendage owing to its shape and the trabeculations within it is thought to play a major role. Obliteration or amputation of the LAA may help to reduce the risk of thromboembolism, but this may result in undesirable physiological sequelae such as reduced atrial compliance and a reduced capacity for ANF secretion in response to pressure and volume overload.},

	title = {Dissecting inflammatory and chemotactic pathways in {Familial} {Mediterrean} {Fever}},
	abstract = {Background: Familial Mediterrean fever (FMF) is a heritable autoinflammatory disease characterized by substantial neutrophil influx at sites of serosal and synovial involvement. Inflammatory attacks are usually prevented by prophylaxis with colchicine, a microtubule inhibitor. Pyrin, the FMF protein, colocalizes with microtubules and may impact leukocyte cytoskeletal functions such as adhesion and migration. We therefore sought to further investigate leukocyte migration in FMF. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 25 treated patients, 10 untreated patients, and 16 controls. Subsets of patients were studied in several assays. Chemokines produced from cultured supernatants and from serum samples were evaluated with the Luminex immunoassay. Chemotaxis assays included a transwell system and a live imaging protocol with granulocytes stimulated to various chemoattractants, including MIP-1 alpha, IL-8 and fMLP. Analysis of gene expression sequences with the Affymetrix system was utilized in 8-paired patient samples who underwent colchicine withdrawal. Results: Microarray analysis revealed a {\textquotedblleft}chemotactic signature{\textquotedblright} induced by colchicine withdrawal with upregulation of major chemotactic genes including CRK, BCL6, ADAMTS 10, and downregulation of genes involving chemokine receptors and cell adhesion molecules such as CCR 7 and CXCR3. At 72 hours off colchicine, monocytes from FMF patients stimulated with LPS produced more TNF-alpha and IL-12p70. Moreover, neutrophil activation was increased, as seen with the downregulation of the L-selectin marker, CD 62L. Patients off colchicine demonstrated significant hyperresponsive cell movement compared with treated patients and controls, although such movement was found to be random (chemokinetic) and less directed (chemotactic) when visualized. FMF patients on colchicine showed elevated serum levels of the chemokines, MIP-1 alpha and beta, as compared to controls. Conclusion: A cascade of intracellular events involving chemokine signaling can impact leukocyte migration in FMF. Current studies are focused on determining the extent to which these effects represent the underlying pathophysiology of FMF, independent of colchicine, by studying colchicine na{\"i}ve patients.},

A particular strength of CMR compared to other imaging modalities is the ability to visualize ablation lesions. Post-procedure CMR is now being applied to assess ablation lesion location and permanence with the goal of indentifying factors leading to procedure success and failure. In the future, intra-procedure real-time CMR, together with the ability to image complex 3-D arrhythmogenic anatomy and target additional ablation to regions of incomplete lesion formation, may allow for more successful treatment of even complex arrhythmias without exposure to ionizing radiation. Development of clinical grade CMR compatible electrophysiology devices is required to transition intra-procedure CMR from pre-clinical studies to more routine use in patients.},

	abstract = {Background

Catheter contact force (CF) is an important determinant of radiofrequency (RF) lesion quality during pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows good visualization of ablation lesions.


Objective

This study describes a new technique to examine the relationship between CF during RF delivery and LGE signal intensity (SI) following PVI.


Methods

Six patients underwent PVI for paroxysmal AF using a CF-sensing catheter and following preprocedural MRI. During ablation, CF-time integral (FTI) and position was documented for each RF application. All patients underwent repeat LGE MRI 3 months later. The LGE SIs were projected onto a MRI-derived 3-dimensional left atrial (LA) shell and a CF map was generated on the same shell. The entire LA surface was divided into 5 mm2 segments. Force and LGE maps were fused and compared for each 5 mm2 zone. An effective lesion was defined when MRI-defined scar occupied {\textgreater}90\% of a 5 mm2 analysis zone.


Results

Acute PVI was achieved in 100\%. Two hundred sixty-eight RF lesions were tagged on the LA shells and given a lesion-specific FTI. Increasing FTI correlated with increased LGE SI, which was greater when the FTI was {\textgreater} 1,200 gs. Below an FTI of 1,200 gs, an increment in the FTI resulted in only a small increment in scar, whereas above 1,200 gs an increment in the FTI resulted in a large change of scar.


Conclusion

There is a correlation between FTI and LGE SI in MRI following AF ablation. Real-time FTI maps are feasible and may prevent inadequate lesion formation.},

	abstract = {Background--Accurate mapping of the site of origin and activation sequence of a cardiac arrhythmia is essential for a successful catheter ablation procedure. To achieve this, precise and reproducible catheter manipulation is mandatory. The aim of this study was (1) to assess the accuracy of a new nonfluoroscopic mapping system in humans and (2) to report the first result of endocardial activation mapping with this system during sinus rhythm and several types of supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. Methods and Results--Fifteen patients were studied. Accuracy measurements were performed in 5 of them (patients 5, 6, 7, 8, and 14). The distances between two subsequent catheter positions in the inferior caval vein as determined by the nonfluoroscopic mapping system were compared with measurements made with calipers by four independent investigators using identification marks on the catheter shaft. The difference between these two methods was 0.95\{+/-\}0.8 mm. In 15 patients, activation of the right atrium and/or the right or left ventricle was recorded during sinus rhythm. Three-dimensional activation maps were constructed in patients with atrial and ventricular tachycardias and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Conclusions--With this new nonfluoroscopic mapping technique, accurate positioning of the catheter tip is possible. A three-dimensional activation map can be reconstructed during sinus rhythm and during supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias of different compartments of the heart.},

	abstract = {In the light of technologic advances and the development of new imaging planes, the feasibility of two-dimensional echocardiographic visualization of coronary artery anatomy was reevaluated in the adult. Thirty-five subjects were studied using an ultrasonograph equipped with a 3.5 and 5.0 MHz annular array transducer, digital processing and cine loop review. There were 18 normal subjects and 17 patients with heart disease, including 9 patients with valvular, 5 patients with coronary, 2 patients with congenital and 1 patient with cardiomyopathic disease. The mean age was 47 {\textpm} 18 years (range 17 to 79). Modifications of standard parasternal and apical views permitted high quality images of portions of each of the major epicardial vessels adequate for assessment of luminal diameter.

The left main coronary artery was seen in 30 (86\%) of the 35 subjects and its bifurcation was seen in 15. The left anterior descending coronary artery was seen in 30 subjects (mean length 3.9 {\textpm} 2.3 cm, maximal length 7.5), the left circumflex artery in 11 (1.1 {\textpm} 1.0, maximal 3.0) and the right coronary artery in 32 (5.6 {\textpm} 2.6, maximal 12). Proximal and mid portions of the left anterior descending artery were seen in 23 and 11 subjects, respectively. The average proximal length visualized was 4.2 cm, and the average luminal diameter visualized was 4.9 mm. The average length of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery seen was 1.9 cm and the average luminal diameter seen was 4.6 mm. The proximal right coronary artery was seen in 17 subjects (average visualized length 2.7 cm and average diameter 3.1 mm). Portions of the mid right coronary artery were seen in 24 subjects (average length 3.6 cm and average diameter 3.1 mm). An average of 2.9 cm of the distal right coronary artery was seen in 18 subjects (average diameter 2.7 mm). Septal or diagonal branches were seen in 11 (31\%) of the 35 subjects, a marginal branch in 1, the coronary sinus in all and smaller veins in 3. Coronary artery lesions were correctly identified in four of five subjects (two in the left anterior descending, one in the left main and one in the right coronary artery), but these were obscured in one subject by a calcified aortic valve.

Improved instrumentation combined with new imaging techniques permits extensive visualization of the adult coronary vasculature. The clinical utility of this technique for the noninvasive evaluation of coronary artery disease remains to be determined.},

All patients underwent DE-MRI to quantify atrial fibrosis as a marker for structural remodeling (SRM) and underwent catheter ablation. Based on the degree of SRM, patients were staged into 4 groups: Utah I (<=5\% LA wall enhancement), Utah II ({\textgreater}5\% to <=20\%), Utah III ({\textgreater}20\% to <=35\%), or Utah IV ({\textgreater}35\%).
RESULTS: Distribution in Utah I to IV was comparable in patients with lone AF and non-lone AF. In both groups, a number of patients showed extensive SRM. Mean enhancement (14.08 {\textpm} 8.94 vs. 16.94 {\textpm} 11.37) was not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = .0721). In the lone AF group, catheter ablation was successful in suppressing AF in all of Utah I, 81.82\% of Utah II, 62.5\% of Utah III, and none of Utah IV patients. Similar results were achieved in the non-lone AF group. Outcome after ablation was significantly dependent on the SRM of the LA (P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSION: The degree of LA structural remodeling as detected using DE-MRI is independent of AF type and associated comorbidities. Selecting appropriate treatment candidates based on the quality and quantity of atrial fibrosis using DE-MRI would improve procedural outcome and avoid unnecessary intervention.},

	abstract = {Objectives~
We sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pulmonary vein (PV) isolation using transvenous cryoablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF).Background
Although electrical isolation of PVs with radiofrequency energy for the treatment of AF is feasible, it is associated with a significant risk of PV stenosis. Cryoablation is a new alternative therapy allowing ablation of tissue while preserving its underlying architecture.Methods
In 52 patients with paroxysmal (n = 45) or persistent (n = 7) AF, PV isolation using the CryoCor cryoablation system (CyroCor Inc., San Diego, California) with a 10F deflectable transvenous catheter was performed as guided by ostial PV potentials. Cryoablation was applied twice at each targeted site (2.5 to 5 min/application). Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax was performed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months to evaluate for PV stenosis.Results
All targeted PVs were completely isolated in 49 (94\%) of 52 of patients. Of 152 PVs targeted, 147 (97\%) were successfully isolated (mean 3.0 PVs isolated per patient). After a mean period of 12.4 {\textpm} 5.5 months of follow-up, 37 (71\%) of 52 patients had no recurrence of AF or were clinically improved, including 29 patients (56\%) who had no recurrence of AF with (n = 11) or without the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs. At 3 and 12 months, the CT scan showed no evidence of PV stenosis associated with cryoablation in any patients.Conclusions
Transvenous catheter cryoablation is an effective method to create PV electrical isolation for the treatment of AF. A clinically satisfactory result can be achieved in 71\% of patients with AF, without the risk of PV stenosis.},

Many previous algorithms applied standard 2D tracking methods to tackle the 3D problem. However, the performance is limited due to increased data size, landmarks ambiguity, signal drop-out or non-rigid deformation. In this paper we present a robust, fast and accurate 3D LV tracking algorithm. We propose a novel one-step forward prediction to generate the motion prior using motion manifold learning, and introduce two collaborative trackers to achieve both temporal consistency and failure recovery. Compared with tracking by detection and 3D optical flow, our algorithm provides the best results and sub-voxel accuracy. The new tracking algorithm is completely automatic and computationally efficient. It requires less than 1.5 seconds to process a 3D volume which contains 4,925,440 voxels.},

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives
To examine a statistical validation method based on the spatial overlap between two sets of segmentations of the same anatomy.

Materials and Methods
The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as a statistical validation metric to evaluate the performance of both the reproducibility of manual segmentations and the spatial overlap accuracy of automated probabilistic fractional segmentation of MR images, illustrated on two clinical examples. Example 1: 10 consecutive cases of prostate brachytherapy patients underwent both preoperative 1.5T and intraoperative 0.5T MR imaging. For each case, 5 repeated manual segmentations of the prostate peripheral zone were performed separately on preoperative and on intraoperative images. Example 2: A semi-automated probabilistic fractional segmentation algorithm was applied to MR imaging of 9 cases with 3 types of brain tumors. DSC values were computed and logit-transformed values were compared in the mean with the analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Results
Example 1: The mean DSCs of 0.883 (range, 0.876{\textendash}0.893) with 1.5T preoperative MRI and 0.838 (range, 0.819{\textendash}0.852) with 0.5T intraoperative MRI (P {\textless} .001) were within and at the margin of the range of good reproducibility, respectively. Example 2: Wide ranges of DSC were observed in brain tumor segmentations: Meningiomas (0.519{\textendash}0.893), astrocytomas (0.487{\textendash}0.972), and other mixed gliomas (0.490{\textendash}0.899).

Conclusion
The DSC value is a simple and useful summary measure of spatial overlap, which can be applied to studies of reproducibility and accuracy in image segmentation. We observed generally satisfactory but variable validation results in two clinical applications. This metric may be adapted for similar validation tasks.},

We determined whether cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can provide a comparable assessment of vascular function. In seventeen control subjects, we used CMR to quantify endothelium-dependent (flow mediated dilatation, FMD) and endothelium-independent dilatation of the brachial artery, brachial and carotid distensibility, aortic compliance, and pulse wave velocity. These were compared to brachial and carotid measurements obtained by established ultrasound protocols. Twelve of the volunteers then underwent repeated measurements with both modalities. There was good agreement between imaging modalities for measures of endothelial function and arterial structure in the same subjects (difference between CMR and ultrasound for FMD = 0.14 {\textpm} 6.8\%, and brachial artery area = - 0.7 {\textpm} 2.2 mm2, correlation between modalities for FMD = 0.62, p = 0.01 and for area = 0.87, p = {\textless} 0.0001). Inter-study reproducibility was also similar (coefficient of variation (CV) for FMD: CMR = 0.3, ultrasound = 0.3, CV for brachial artery area: CMR = 0.1, ultrasound = 0.1). Comparability and reproducibility were not as strong for functional measures if repeated studies were several days apart (CV for FMD by ultrasound on the same day = 0.1 and several days apart = 0.4). CMR and ultrasound show good agreement for quantitative measures of vascular structure and function with good reproducibility for both modalities. The major advantage of CMR is that it allows one-stop integrated assessment of both peripheral and central measures of vascular function.},

	abstract = {Background
Four new oral anticoagulants compare favourably with warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation; however, the balance between efficacy and safety in subgroups needs better definition. We aimed to assess the relative benefit of new oral anticoagulants in key subgroups, and the effects on important secondary outcomes.
Methods
We searched Medline from Jan 1, 2009, to Nov 19, 2013, limiting searches to phase 3, randomised trials of patients with atrial fibrillation who were randomised to receive new oral anticoagulants or warfarin, and trials in which both efficacy and safety outcomes were reported. We did a prespecified meta-analysis of all 71 683 participants included in the RE-LY, ROCKET AF, ARISTOTLE, and ENGAGE AF{\textendash}TIMI 48 trials. The main outcomes were stroke and systemic embolic events, ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. We calculated relative risks (RRs) and 95\% CIs for each outcome. We did subgroup analyses to assess whether differences in patient and trial characteristics affected outcomes. We used a random-effects model to compare pooled outcomes and tested for heterogeneity.
Findings
42 411 participants received a new oral anticoagulant and 29 272 participants received warfarin. New oral anticoagulants significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolic events by 19\% compared with warfarin (RR 0{\textperiodcentered}81, 95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}73{\textendash}0{\textperiodcentered}91; p\&lt;0{\textperiodcentered}0001), mainly driven by a reduction in haemorrhagic stroke (0{\textperiodcentered}49, 0{\textperiodcentered}38{\textendash}0{\textperiodcentered}64; p\&lt;0{\textperiodcentered}0001). New oral anticoagulants also significantly reduced all-cause mortality (0{\textperiodcentered}90, 0{\textperiodcentered}85{\textendash}0{\textperiodcentered}95; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0003) and intracranial haemorrhage (0{\textperiodcentered}48, 0{\textperiodcentered}39{\textendash}0{\textperiodcentered}59; p\&lt;0{\textperiodcentered}0001), but increased gastrointestinal bleeding (1{\textperiodcentered}25, 1{\textperiodcentered}01{\textendash}1{\textperiodcentered}55; p=0{\textperiodcentered}04). We noted no heterogeneity for stroke or systemic embolic events in important subgroups, but there was a greater relative reduction in major bleeding with new oral anticoagulants when the centre-based time in therapeutic range was less than 66\% than when it was 66\% or more (0{\textperiodcentered}69, 0{\textperiodcentered}59{\textendash}0{\textperiodcentered}81 vs 0{\textperiodcentered}93, 0{\textperiodcentered}76{\textendash}1{\textperiodcentered}13; p for interaction 0{\textperiodcentered}022). Low-dose new oral anticoagulant regimens showed similar overall reductions in stroke or systemic embolic events to warfarin (1{\textperiodcentered}03, 0{\textperiodcentered}84{\textendash}1{\textperiodcentered}27; p=0{\textperiodcentered}74), and a more favourable bleeding profile (0{\textperiodcentered}65, 0{\textperiodcentered}43{\textendash}1{\textperiodcentered}00; p=0{\textperiodcentered}05), but significantly more ischaemic strokes (1{\textperiodcentered}28, 1{\textperiodcentered}02{\textendash}1{\textperiodcentered}60; p=0{\textperiodcentered}045).
Interpretation
This meta-analysis is the first to include data for all four new oral anticoagulants studied in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for stroke prevention or systemic embolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation. New oral anticoagulants had a favourable risk{\textendash}benefit profile, with significant reductions in stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and mortality, and with similar major bleeding as for warfarin, but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The relative efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulants was consistent across a wide range of patients. Our findings offer clinicians a more comprehensive picture of the new oral anticoagulants as a therapeutic option to reduce the risk of stroke in this patient population.

	abstract = {The recent development of real-time 3-D ultrasound (US) enables intracardiac beating-heart procedures, but the distorted appearance of surgical instruments is a major challenge to surgeons. In addition, tissue and instruments have similar gray levels in US images and the interface between instruments and tissue is poorly defined. We present an algorithm that automatically estimates instrument location in intracardiac procedures. Expert-segmented images are used to initialize the statistical distributions of blood, tissue and instruments. Voxels are labeled through an iterative expectation-maximization algorithm using information from the neighboring voxels through a smoothing kernel. Once the three classes of voxels are separated, additional neighboring information is combined with the known shape characteristics of instruments to correct for misclassifications. We analyze the major axis of segmented data through their principal components and refine the results by a watershed transform, which corrects the results at the contact between instrument and tissue. We present results on 3-D in-vitro data from a tank trial and 3-D in-vivo data from cardiac interventions on porcine beating hearts, using instruments of four types of materials. The comparison of algorithm results to expert-annotated images shows the correct segmentation and position of the instrument shaft.},

	abstract = {The shape of the mitral valve annulus is used in diagnostic and modeling applications, yet methods to accurately and reproducibly delineate the annulus are limited. This paper presents a mitral annulus segmentation algorithm designed for closed mitral valves which locates the annulus in three-dimensional ultrasound using only a single user-specified point near the center of the valve. The algorithm first constructs a surface at the location of the thin leaflets, and then locates the annulus by finding where the thin leaflet tissue meets the thicker heart wall. The algorithm iterates until convergence metrics are satisfied, resulting in an operator-independent mitral annulus segmentation. The accuracy of the algorithm was assessed from both a diagnostic and surgical standpoint by comparing the algorithm's results to delineations made by a group of experts on clinical ultrasound images of the mitral valve, and to delineations made by an expert with a surgical view of the mitral annulus on excised porcine hearts using an electromagnetically tracked pointer. In the former study, the algorithm was statistically indistinguishable from the best performing expert (p=0.85) and had an average RMS difference of 1.81+/-0.78 mm to the expert average. In the latter, the average RMS difference between the algorithm's annulus and the electromagnetically tracked points across six hearts was 1.19+/-0.17 mm .},

Imaging is also potentially important for prediction of success of catheter ablation. Specifically, patients with larger left atrial size, reduced left atrial function and increased left atrial fibrosis content are more likely to experience atrial fibrillation recurrences after ablation. Routine and advanced echocardiographic imaging techniques and multi-detector row computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can provide detailed information. Currently, imaging techniques are not able to predict success on an individual basis, but it does permit identification of patients with high versus low risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence after ablation. Finally, imaging can be performed after ablation to demonstrate beneficial effects of restoration of sinus rhythm, including left atrial reverse remodelling and improvement in left atrial or ventricular function.

	abstract = {Objectives. We hypothesized that the time course of the recovery of atrial systolic function may be related to the duration of atrial fibrillation before cardioversion and sought to study noninvesively the recovery of left atrial mechanical function utilizing serial transthoracic Doppler studies.

Background. Recovery of atrial mechanical function may be delayed for several weeks after successful cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.

Methods. After successful cardioversion, 60 patients with atrial fibrillation of brief (<=2 week, 17 patients), moderate (\&gt;2 to 6 weeks, 22 patients) or prolonged (\&gt;6 weeks, 21 patients) duration were followed up with serial transmitral pulsed Doppler echocardiography immediately (60 patients) and at 24 h (45 patients), 1 week (41 patients), 1 month (31 patients) and \&gt;3 months (30 patients) after cardioversion.

Results. Atrial mechanical function is greater immediately and at 24 h and 1 week after cardioversion in patients with {\textquotedblleft}brief{\textquotedblright} compared with {\textquotedblleft}prolonged{\textquotedblright} atrial fibrillation. In all groups, atrial mechanical function increases over time, ultimately achieving similar levels. Full recovery of atrial mechanical function, however, is achieved within 24 h in patients with brief atrial fibrillation, within 1 week in patients with moderate-duration atrial fibrillation and within 1 month in patients with prolonged atrial fibrillation.

Conclusions. Recovery of left atrial mechanical function is related to the duration of atrial fibrillation before cardioversion. These findings have important implications for assessing the early hemodynamic benefit of successful cardioversion.},

The Radon transform is a mapping between the image space and a parameter space. The coordinates of a point in the latter correspond to the parameters of a shape in the image. The amplitude at that point corresponds to the amount of evidence for that shape. In this paper we discuss three important aspects of the Radon transform. The first aspect is discretization. Using concepts from sampling theory we derive a set of sampling criteria for the generalized Radon transform. The second aspect is accuracy. For the specific case of the Radon transform for spheres, we examine how well the location of the maxima matches the true parameters. We derive a correction term to reduce the bias in the estimated radii. The third aspect concerns a projection-based algorithm to reduce memory requirements.},

This modality of electrical stimulation was achieved by the combination of QRS- inhibited ventricular demand pacing with QRS-inhibited atrial demand stimulation. In the presence of atrial bradycardia and normal AV conduction only the atria were stimulated. When sinus slowing was associated with AV block, both atria and ventricles were paced. A double electrode system was required for the restoration of AV synchronization. Consistent atrial capture was achieved by means of a J-shaped endocardial bipolar electrode. Permanent bifocal demand pacing has also been used in three patients with satisfactory results. Although both the concept and applicability of bifocal demand pacing were proved, further studies are required to assess the optimal AV sequential interval as well as the long-term electrical reliability and hemodynamics benefits.},

Electroanatomic mapping was performed endocardially (n = 33) and epicardially (n = 19). The LP were defined as low voltage electrograms ({\textless}1.5 mV) with onset after the QRS interval. Very late potentials (vLP) were defined as electrograms with onset {\textgreater}100 ms after the QRS.
RESULTS: We sampled an average of 564 +/- 449 points and 726 +/- 483 points in the left ventricle endocardium and epicardium, respectively. Mean total low voltage area in patients with ICM was 101 +/- 55 cm(2) and 56 +/- 33 cm(2), endocardial and epicardial, respectively, compared with NICM of 55 +/- 41 cm(2) and 53 +/- 28 cm(2), respectively. Within the total low voltage area, vLP were observed more frequently in ICM than in NICM in endocardium (4.1\% vs. 1.3\%; p = 0.0003) and epicardium (4.3\% vs. 2.1\%, p = 0.035). An LP-targeted ablation strategy was effective in ICM patients (82\% nonrecurrence at 12 +/- 10 months of follow-up), whereas NICM patients had less favorable outcomes (50\% at 15 +/- 13 months of follow-up).
CONCLUSIONS: The contribution of scar to the electrophysiological abnormalities targeted for ablation of unstable ventricular tachycardia differs between ICM and NICM. An approach incorporating LP ablation and pace-mapping had limited success in patients with NICM compared with ICM, and alternative ablation strategies should be considered.},

	abstract = {The Hough transform is a method for detecting curves by exploiting the duality between points on a curve and parameters of that curve. The initial work showed how to detect both analytic curves(1,2) and non-analytic curves,(3) but these methods were restricted to binary edge images. This work was generalized to the detection of some analytic curves in grey level images, specifically lines,(4) circles(5) and parabolas.(6) The line detection case is the best known of these and has been ingeniously exploited in several applications.(7,8,9)

We show how the boundaries of an arbitrary non-analytic shape can be used to construct a mapping between image space and Hough transform space. Such a mapping can be exploited to detect instances of that particular shape in an image. Furthermore, variations in the shape such as rotations, scale changes or figure ground reversals correspond to straightforward transformations of this mapping. However, the most remarkable property is that such mappings can be composed to build mappings for complex shapes from the mappings of simpler component shapes. This makes the generalized Hough transform a kind of universal transform which can be used to find arbitrarily complex shapes.},

The pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity patterns, characterized by a rapid rise in flow velocity immediately after closure of the pulmonary valve and a gradual deceleration until the next pulmonary valve opening, were successfully obtained in 18 of the 21 patients with pulmonary hypertension and in 13 of the 24 patients without pulmonary hypertension. As pulmonary artery pressure increased, pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity became higher; the pulmonary artery-to-right ventricular pressure gradient in diastole (PG) was estimated from the pulmonary regurgitant flow velocity (V) by means of the simplified Bernoulli equation (PG = 4V2). The Doppler-determined pressure gradient at end-diastole correlated well with the catheter measurement of the pressure gradient at end-diastole (r = .94, SEE = 3 mm Hg) and with pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure (r = .92, SEE = 4 mm Hg). The peak of Doppler-determined pressure gradient during diastole correlated well with mean pulmonary artery pressure (r = .92, SEE = 5 mm Hg). Thus continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography was useful for noninvasive estimation of pulmonary artery pressures.},

	abstract = {Background
Contact mapping of the ventricle with NAVX has not been validated.
Objective
This study sought to compare the accuracy of infarct mapping between NAVX and CARTO using a histopathologic gold standard.
Methods
A closed-chest porcine infarction model was created by circumflex artery occlusion. After 4 to 12 weeks, 7 subjects underwent high-density endocardial and epicardial mapping using CARTO (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, California) and NAVX (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, Minnesota) mapping systems. After mapping, animals were euthanized and histopathologic examination was used to quantify areas of scar at depths of 1 to 4 mm.
Results
Using a single-point acquisition approach with CARTO and a multipoint acquisition approach with the NAVX, endocardial and epicardial maps created using CARTO consisted of 360 {\textpm} 121 points performed in 54 {\textpm} 23 minutes/361 {\textpm} 90 points in 41 {\textpm} 13 minutes compared with 697 {\textpm} 132 points in 35 {\textpm} 8 minutes/1,303 {\textpm} 207 points in 30 {\textpm} 11 minutes using NAVX. At a 2-mm depth from the endocardial and epicardial surface, the mean scar area quantified by histopathology was 9.5 {\textpm} 8.7 cm2 and 6.2 {\textpm} 4.8 cm2, respectively. Correlation between histopathology and electroanatomic maps was excellent (r = 0.88, CARTO and 0.92, NAVX). Correlation between scar area determined by CARTO and NAVX was good (r = 0.88, P {\textless}.0001).
Conclusion
Balloon occlusion-reperfusion of the circumflex artery creates a localized patchy infarction in the inferolateral wall. Multipolar mapping achieves higher density in a shorter period of time and increases the detection of late potentials. A strong correlation between CARTO and NAVX exists, and both systems demonstrate good correlation with histopathologic quantification of scar.},

	abstract = {Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is an effective treatment for patients with congestive heart failure and a wide QRS complex. However, up to 30\% of patients are non-responders to therapy in terms of exercise capacity or left ventricular reverse remodelling. A number of controversies still remain surrounding patient selection, targeted lead implantation and optimisation of this important treatment. The development of biophysical models to predict the response to CRT represents a potential strategy to address these issues. In this article, we present how the personalisation of an electromechanical model of the myocardium can predict the acute haemodynamic changes associated with CRT. In order to introduce such an approach as a clinical application, we needed to design models that can be individualised from images and electrophysiological mapping of the left ventricle. In this paper the personalisation of the anatomy, the electrophysiology, the kinematics and the mechanics are described. The acute effects of pacing on pressure development were predicted with the in silico model for several pacing conditions on two patients, achieving good agreement with invasive haemodynamic measurements: the mean error on dP/dtmax is 47.5 {\textpm} 35 mm Hg s-1, less than 5\% error. These promising results demonstrate the potential of physiological models personalised from images and electrophysiology signals to improve patient selection and plan CRT.},

Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote or averaging) the predictions of the ensemble. We built predictive models for six cheminformatics data sets. Our analysis demonstrates that Random Forest is a powerful tool capable of delivering performance that is among the most accurate methods to date. We also present three additional features of Random Forest:? built-in performance assessment, a measure of relative importance of descriptors, and a measure of compound similarity that is weighted by the relative importance of descriptors. It is the combination of relatively high prediction accuracy and its collection of desired features that makes Random Forest uniquely suited for modeling in cheminformatics.},

	abstract = {The history of interventional electrophysiology is long and fascinating. In the beginning, there is not simply the anatomy and physiology of the heart, but also analysis of the pulse, which indicates the activity of the heart. The analysis of the (peripheral) pulse as a mechanical expression of heart activity goes back several millennia. In China, in 280 B.C., Wang Chu Ho wrote ten books about the pulse. The Greeks called the pulse "sphygmos", and the sphygmology thus deals with a theory of this natural occurrence. In Roman times, Galen interpreted the various types of pulse according to the widespread presumption of the time, that each organ in every disease has its own form of pulse. The basic tool for arrhythmia diagnosis became the electrocardiography introduced by Willem Einthoven who obtained the first human electrogram 1902 in Leiden, The Netherlands. The growing clinical importance of electrical cardiac stimulation has been recognized and renewed as Zoll (1911-1999) in 1952 reported a successful resuscitation in cardiac standstill by external stimulation. Meanwhile all over the world, millions of patients with cardiac arrhythmias have been treated with pacemakers in the last 45 years. The concept of a fully automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator system (ICD) for recognition and treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was first suggested in 1970. The first implantation of the device in a human being was performed in February 1980. Further developments concern atrial and atrioventricular defibrillators, radiofrequency ablation, laser therapy and advanced antiarrhythmic surgery, new antiarrhythmic drugs and sophisticated devices for preventive pacing. The advances in the field of diagnostic and therapeutic application of pharmacologic and electrical tools as well as alternative methods will continue as rapidly as before in order to give us further significant aid in taking care of the patient.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Late Gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can be used to visualise regions of fibrosis and scarring in the left atrium (LA) myocardium. This can be important for treatment stratification of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and for assessment of treatment after radio frequency catheter ablation (RFCA). In this paper we present a standardised evaluation benchmarking framework for algorithms segmenting fibrosis and scar from LGE CMR images. The algorithms reported are the response to an open challenge that was put to the medical imaging community through an ISBI (IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging) workshop.
METHODS: The image database consisted of 60 multicenter, multivendor LGE CMR image datasets from patients with AF, with 30 images taken before and 30 after RFCA for the treatment of AF. A reference standard for scar and fibrosis was established by merging manual segmentations from three observers. Furthermore, scar was also quantified using 2, 3 and 4 standard deviations (SD) and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) methods. Seven institutions responded to the challenge: Imperial College (IC), Mevis Fraunhofer (MV), Sunnybrook Health Sciences (SY), Harvard/Boston University (HB), Yale School of Medicine (YL), King's College London (KCL) and Utah CARMA (UTA, UTB). There were 8 different algorithms evaluated in this study.
RESULTS: Some algorithms were able to perform significantly better than SD and FWHM methods in both pre- and post-ablation imaging. Segmentation in pre-ablation images was challenging and good correlation with the reference standard was found in post-ablation images. Overlap scores (out of 100) with the reference standard were as follows: Pre: IC = 37, MV = 22, SY = 17, YL = 48, KCL = 30, UTA = 42, UTB = 45; Post: IC = 76, MV = 85, SY = 73, HB = 76, YL = 84, KCL = 78, UTA = 78, UTB = 72.
CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that currently no algorithm is deemed clearly better than others. There is scope for further algorithmic developments in LA fibrosis and scar quantification from LGE CMR images. Benchmarking of future scar segmentation algorithms is thus important. The proposed benchmarking framework is made available as open-source and new participants can evaluate their algorithms via a web-based interface.},

	abstract = {Background Although Doppler color flow mapping is widely used to assess the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR), a simple, accurate, and quantitative marker of MR by color flow mapping remains elusive. We hypothesized that vena contracta width by color flow mapping would accurately predict the severity of MR.
Methods and Results We studied 80 patients with MR. Vena contracta width was measured in multiple views with zoom mode and nonstandard angulation to optimize its visualization. Flow volumes across the left ventricular outflow tract and mitral annulus were calculated by pulsed-Doppler technique to determine regurgitant volume. Effective regurgitant orifice area was calculated by dividing the regurgitant volume by the continuous-wave Doppler velocity-time integral of the MR jet. The cause of MR was ischemia in 24, dilated cardiomyopathy in 34, mitral valve prolapse in 12, endocarditis in 2, rheumatic disease in 2, mitral annular calcification in 1, and uncertain in 5. Regurgitant volumes ranged from 2 to 191 mL. Regurgitant orifice area ranged from 0.01 to 1.47 cm2. Single-plane vena contracta width from the parasternal long-axis view correlated well with regurgitant volume (r=.85, SEE=20 mL) and regurgitant orifice area (r=.86, SEE=0.15 cm2). Biplane vena contracta width from apical views correlated well with regurgitant volume (r=.85, SEE=19 mL) and regurgitant orifice area (r=.88, SEE=0.14 cm2). A biplane vena contracta width >=0.5 cm was always associated with a regurgitant volume {\textgreater}60 mL and a regurgitant orifice area {\textgreater}0.4 cm2. A biplane vena contracta width <=0.3 cm predicted a regurgitant volume {\textless}60 mL and a regurgitant orifice area {\textless}0.4 cm2 in 24 of 29 patients. No other parameter, including jet area, left atrial size, pulmonary flow reversal, or semiquantitative MR grade, correlated significantly with regurgitant volume or regurgitant orifice area in a multivariate analysis.
Conclusions Our results demonstrate that careful color flow mapping of the vena contracta of the MR jet provides a simple quantitative assessment of MR that correlates well with quantitative Doppler techniques.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, characteristics and the predictive value of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) for subsequent death and arrhythmic events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND Nonsustained VT has been linked to an increased risk for sudden death in coronary patients. It is unknown whether this parameter can be used for selection of high-risk patients to receive an implantable defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden death in patients shortly after AMI. METHODS In 325 consecutive infarct survivors, 24-h Holter monitoring was performed 10 \{+/-\} 6 days after AMI. All patients underwent coronary angiography, determination of left ventricular function and assessment of heart rate variability (HRV). Mean follow-up was 30 \{+/-\} 22 months. RESULTS There was a low prevalence (9\%) of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Nonsustained VT together with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found in only 2.4\% of patients. During follow-up, 25 patients reached one of the prospectively defined end points (primary composite end point of cardiac death, sustained VT or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation; secondary end point: arrhythmic events). Kaplan Meier event probability analyses revealed that only HRV, LVEF and status of the infarct-related artery were univariate predictors of death or arrhythmic events. The presence of nonsustained VT carried a relative risk of 2.6 for the primary study end point but was not a significant predictor if only arrhythmic events were considered. On multivariate analysis, only HRV, LVEF and the status of the infarct artery were found to be independently related to the primary study end point. CONCLUSIONS There is a low prevalence of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Only 2\% to 3\% of all infarct survivors treated according to contemporary guidelines demonstrate both depressed LVEF and nonsustained VT. The predictive value of nonsustained VT for subsequent mortality and arrhythmic events is inferior to that of impaired autonomic tone, LVEF or infarct-related artery patency. Accordingly, the use of nonsustained VT to select patients for primary implantable cardioverter/defibrillator prevention trials shortly after AMI appears to be limited.},

	doi = {10.1109/TBME.2012.2233738},
	abstract = {Electroanatomical voltage mapping (EAVM) is commonly performed prior to catheter ablation of scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT) to locate the arrhythmic substrate and to guide the ablation procedure. EAVM is used to locate the position of the ablation catheter and to provide a 3-D reconstruction of left-ventricular anatomy and scar. However, EAVM measurements only represent the endocardial scar with no transmural or epicardial information. Furthermore, EAVM is a time-consuming procedure, with a high operator dependence and has low sampling density, i.e., spatial resolution. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows noninvasive assessment of scar morphology that can depict 3-D scar architecture. Despite the potential use of LGE as a roadmap for VT ablation for identification of arrhythmogenic substrate, its utility has been very limited. To allow for identification of VT substrate, a correlation is needed between the substrates identified by EAVM as the gold standard and LGE-MRI scar characteristics. To do so, a system must be developed to fuse the datasets from these modalities. In this study, a registration pipeline for the fusion of LGE-MRI and EAVM data is presented. A novel surface registration algorithm is proposed, integrating the matching of global scar areas as an additional constraint in the registration process. A preparatory landmark registration is initially performed to expedite the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the registration in the presence of errors in identifying landmarks in EAVM or LGE-MRI datasets as well as additional errors due to respiratory or cardiac motion. Subsequently, the accuracy of the proposed fusion system was evaluated in a cohort of ten patients undergoing VT ablation where both EAVM and LGE-MRI data were available. Compared to landmark registration and surface registration, the presented method achieved significant improvemen- in registration error. The proposed data fusion system allows the fusion of EAVM and LGE-MRI data in VT ablation with registration errors less than 3.5 mm.},

	abstract = {A randomized, multicenter comparison of two intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs) was carried out. Nine hundred thirty-seven women were fitted with a copper-releasing IUD, the Nova-T, and 1821 women with an IUD that releases 20 micrograms of levonorgestrel daily. After 36 months, the cumulative gross rates of amenorrhea and hormonal side effects were significantly higher in the levonorgestrel-IUD users. The cumulative 36-month gross pregnancy rate was 3.7 for the Nova-T and 0.3 for the levonorgestrel IUD (P less than .001), demonstrating the levonorgestrel IUD's high contraceptive efficacy. For the first time, a protective effect of the levonorgestrel IUD against pelvic inflammatory disease as compared with the Nova-T was seen statistically. The cumulative 36-month gross rate of pelvic inflammatory disease was 2.0 in Nova-T- and 0.5 in levonorgestrel-IUD users (P less than .013). This significantly lowered incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease may help to solve one of the major concerns associated with intrauterine contraception.},

Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the potential of circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) to maintain sinus rhythm (SR) over time, thus reducing mortality and morbidity while enhancing quality of life (QoL).
BACKGROUND: Circumferential PV ablation is safe and effective, but the long-term outcomes and its impact on QoL have not been assessed or compared with those for medical therapy.
METHODS: We examined the clinical course of 1,171 consecutive patients with symptomatic AF who were referred to us between January 1998 and March 2001. The 589 ablated patients were compared with the 582 who received antiarrhythmic medications for SR control. The QoL of 109 ablated and 102 medically treated patients was measured with the SF-36 survey.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 900 days (range 161 to 1,508 days). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed observed survival for ablated patients was longer than among patients treated medically (p {\textless} 0.001), and not different from that expected for healthy persons of the same gender and calendar year of birth (p = 0.55). Cox proportional-hazards model revealed in the ablation group hazard ratios of 0.46 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.68; p {\textless} 0.001) for all-cause mortality, of 0.45 (95\% CI, 0.31 to 0.64; p {\textless} 0.001) for morbidities mainly due to heart failure and ischemic cerebrovascular events, and of 0.30 (95\% CI, 0.24 to 0.37; p {\textless} 0.001) for AF recurrence. Ablated patients' QoL, different from patients treated medically, reached normative levels at six months and remained unchanged at one year.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary vein ablation improves mortality, morbidity, and QoL as compared with medical therapy. Our findings pave the way for randomized trials to prospect a wider application of ablation therapy for AF.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash} The normal sinus pacemaker complex is an extensive structure within the right atrium. We hypothesized that patients with sinus node disease (SND) would have evidence of diffuse atrial abnormalities.
Methods and Results{\textemdash} Sixteen patients with symptomatic SND and 16 age-matched controls were studied. The following were evaluated: effective refractory periods (ERPs) from the high and low lateral right atrium (RA), high septal RA, and distal coronary sinus (CS); conduction time along the CS and lateral RA; P-wave duration; and conduction at the crista terminalis. Electroanatomic mapping was performed to define the sinus node complex and determine regional conduction velocity, double potentials, fractionated electrograms, regional voltage, and areas of electrical silence. Patients with SND demonstrated significant increase in atrial ERP at all right atrial sites, increased atrial conduction time along the lateral RA and CS, prolongation of the P-wave duration, and greater number and duration of double potentials along the crista terminalis. Electroanatomic mapping demonstrated the sinus node complex in SND to be more often unicentric, localized to the low crista terminalis at the site of the largest residual voltage amplitude. There was significant regional conduction slowing with double potentials and fractionation associated with areas of low voltage and electrical silence (or scar).
Conclusions{\textemdash} SND is associated with diffuse atrial remodeling characterized by structural change, conduction abnormalities, and increased right atrial refractoriness. There was a change in the nature of sinus pacemaker activity with loss of the normal multicentric pattern of activation, caudal shift of the pacemaker complex, and abnormal and circuitous conduction around lines of conduction block.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two sets of electron-beam CT scans were obtained in patients with coronary calcification (group A) or known risk factors for coronary arterial disease (group B). The second set or scans was obtained after a brief interval (group A, n = 52) or after 1 year with no risk modification (group B, n = 27). Traditional (plaque area and attenuation) and volumetric calcium scores were calculated for each patient and lesion. RESULTS: The median percentage change for individual lesions in group A was 13\% for the volumetric and 19\% for the traditional score. The overall reduction in error with the volumetric score was 40\% (P {\textless} .001). The median percentage change for group A patient totals was 9\% for the volumetric and 15\% for the traditional score (P {\textless} .001). In group B patients, the median volumetric score increased by 44\% after 1 year. CONCLUSION: The volumetric score showed better reproducibility than the traditional score, and its variability was considerably less than the score increase in untreated patients after 1 year. The reproducibility of the volumetric method makes it useful for assessing the progression of coronary arterial disease on serial electron-beam CT studies.},

	abstract = {Cardiac electrical imaging from body surface potential measurements is increasingly being seen as a technology with the potential for use in the clinic, for example for pre-procedure planning or during-treatment guidance for ventricular arrhythmia ablation procedures. However several important impediments to widespread adoption of this technology remain to be effectively overcome. Here we address two of these impediments: the difficulty of reconstructing electric potentials on the inner (endocardial) as well as outer (epicardial) surfaces of the ventricles, and the need for full anatomical imaging of the subject's thorax to build an accurate subject-specific geometry. We introduce two new features in our reconstruction algorithm: a nonlinear low-order dynamic parameterization derived from the measured body surface signals, and a technique to jointly regularize both surfaces. With these methodological innovations in combination, it is possible to reconstruct endocardial activation from clinically acquired measurements with an imprecise thorax geometry. In particular we test the method using body surface potentials acquired from three subjects during clinical procedures where the subjects' hearts were paced on their endocardia using a catheter device. Our geometric models were constructed using a set of CT scans limited in axial extent to the immediate region near the heart. The catheter system provides a reference location to which we compare our results. We compare our estimates of pacing site localization, in terms of both accuracy and stability, to those reported in a recent clinical publication , where a full set of CT scans were available and only epicardial potentials were reconstructed.},

	abstract = {Recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after catheter ablation has been associated with left atrial (LA) fibrosis. However, arbitrary units of measure limit the interpatient comparison of delayed enhancement intensity. We sought to quantify LA fibrosis using a novel normalized measure: the image intensity ratio (IIR) of late-gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI).
LGE-MRI images (1.5 Tesla) were obtained in 30 patients (37\% female, mean age 62 {\textpm} 8) prior to first (60\%), second (23\%), or third (17\%) ablation procedure for AF. Multiplanar reformatted images were reconstructed from the stack of 3-D axial image data. Epicardial and endocardial contours were manually drawn around LA myocardium. The IIR, defined as local LA myocardial signal intensity divided by the mean LA blood pool image intensity, was measured for each of 20 sectors created on contiguous axial planes through the LA. Electroanatomic map (EAM) points were registered to the corresponding LGE-MRI images using custom software.
A total of 2569 EAM points were analyzed. The average bipolar voltage was 0.9 {\textpm} 1.0 mV (0.5 between and 0.9 within patient standard deviation). Local IIR was strongly associated with bipolar voltage (Figure, P {\textless}.001). Using a generalized estimating equations model clustered by patient and adjusting for age, LA volume, rhythm, gender, CHADS score, and type of AF, each unit increase in local IIR was associated with {\textendash}1.4 mV decrease in bipolar LA voltage (P {\textless}.001).
Higher IIR values were observed in areas with lower bipolar voltage on EAM. The IIR obtained from LGE-MRI may improve the quantification of LA fibrosis},

	abstract = {This manuscript presents a framework for the pre-clinical validation of LBM-EP, a fast cardiac electrophysiology model based on the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). The overarching goal is to assess whether the model is able to predict ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction given lead location and stimulation protocol. First, the random-walk algorithm is used to interactively segment the heart ventricles from delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance images (DE-MRI). Scar and border zone are visually delineated using image thresholding. Then, a detailed anatomical model is generated, comprising fiber architecture and spatial distribution of action potential duration. That information is rasterized to a Cartesian grid, and the cardiac potentials are computed. The framework is illustrated on one swine data, for which two different pacing protocols at four different sites were tested. Each of the protocols were then virtually tested by computing seven seconds of heart beat. Model predictions in terms of VT induction were compared with what was observed in the animal. Our parallel implementation on graphics processing units required a total computation time of about two minutes at an isotropic grid resolution of 0.8 mm (21s at a resolution of 1.5 mm), thus enabling interactive VT testing.},

Implementation of these procedures is hampered by the difficulty of manipulating tissue guided by the distorted, low resolution 3DUS images and the dexterity constraints imposed by the confined intracardiac space. This paper investigates the use of surgical robotics in conjunction with 3DUS to overcome these limitations. In addition, it describes the development of a graphics processor based volume Tenderer for real-time stereo visualization of the ultrasound data. Stereo displayed 3DUS was compared to ID-displayed 3DUS and endoscopic guidance with a user study. Five subjects performed in vitro surgical tasks using a surgical robot. Results indicate that subjects were able to complete surgical tasks 35 \% faster with stereo-displayed 3DUS images compared to conventional two dimensional display of 3DUS.},

	doi = {10.1109/TMI.2014.2360988},
	abstract = {Echocardiography is a potential alternative to X-ray fluoroscopy in cardiac catheterization given its richness in soft tissue information and its lack of ionizing radiation. However, its small field of view and acoustic artifacts make direct automatic segmentation of the catheters very challenging. In this study, a fast catheter segmentation framework for echocardiographic imaging guided by the segmentation of corresponding X-ray fluoroscopic imaging is proposed. The complete framework consists of: (1) catheter initialization in the first X-ray frame; (2) catheter tracking in the rest of the X-ray sequence; (3) fast registration of corresponding X-ray and ultrasound frames; and (4) catheter segmentation in ultrasound images guided by the results of both X-ray tracking and fast registration. The main contributions include: (1) a Kalman filter-based growing strategy with more clinical data evalution; (2) a SURF detector applied in a constrained search space for catheter segmentation in ultrasound images; (3) a two layer hierarchical graph model to integrate and smooth catheter fragments into a complete catheter; and (4) the integration of these components into a system for clinical applications. This framework is evaluated on 5 sequences of porcine data and 4 sequences of patient data comprising more than 3000 X-ray frames and more than 1000 ultrasound frames. The results show that our algorithm is able to track the catheter in ultrasound images at 1.3 seconds per frame, with an error of less than 2 mm. However, although this may satisfy the accuracy for visualization purposes and is also fast, the algorithm still needs to be further accelerated for real-time clinical applications.},

The difference in survival after PCI or CABG was less than 1\% over 10 years of follow-up. Survival did not differ between PCI and CABG for patients with diabetes in the 6 trials that reported on this subgroup. Procedure-related strokes were more common after CABG than after PCI (1.2\% vs. 0.6\%; risk difference, 0.6\%; P{\^A}~= 0.002). Angina relief was greater after CABG than after PCI, with risk differences ranging from 5\% to 8\% at 1 to 5 years (P {\textless} 0.001). The absolute rates of angina relief at 5 years were 79\% after PCI and 84\% after CABG. Repeated revascularization was more common after PCI than after CABG (risk difference, 24\% at 1 year and 33\% at 5 years; P {\textless} 0.001); the absolute rates at 5 years were 46.1\% after balloon angioplasty, 40.1\% after PCI with stents, and 9.8\% after CABG. In the observational studies, the CABG{\^a}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}PCI hazard ratio for death favored PCI among patients with the least severe disease and CABG among those with the most severe disease.Limitations: The RCTs were conducted in leading centers in selected patients. The authors could not assess whether comparative outcomes vary according to clinical factors, such as extent of coronary disease, ejection fraction, or previous procedures. Only 1 small trial used drug-eluting stents.Conclusion: Compared with PCI, CABG was more effective in relieving angina and led to fewer repeated revascularizations but had a higher risk for procedural stroke. Survival to 10 years was similar for both procedures.},

	abstract = {Background
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency (RF) ablation in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, by comparatively analyzing the outcomes of the patients who underwent RF ablation with those of patients who underwent Cox/Maze III surgery.
Methods
Between April 1995 and June 2002, 70 patients underwent surgery for atrial fibrillation and open-heart surgery at the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of the University of Bologna: 30 patients underwent the surgical Cox/Maze III procedure (group 1), and 40 patients underwent the RF ablation according to the Maze III configuration at least on the left atrium (group 2). There were 14 males and 56 females, with a mean age of 61.5 {\textpm} 12.5 years (range 22 to 80 years old).
Results
Groups 1 and 2 did not differ in terms of baseline characteristics. The perioperative mortality rate was not significantly different between the two groups (6.6\% in group 1 vs 7.5\% in group 2). The overall cumulative rates of sinus rhythm were 68.9\% in group 1 and 88.5\% in group 2 (not statistically significant). Biatrial contraction was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography in 70.4\% of the patients in group 1 and 76.5\% of the patients in group 2 (p = 0.65).
Conclusions
The RF ablation procedure offers as good results as the Cox/Maze III operation, allowing recovery of the sinus rhythm and atrial function in the great majority of patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent open heart surgery; it is a safe and effective means of curing atrial fibrillation with negligible technical and time requirements.},

Research shows that this threat dramatically depresses the standardized test performance of women and African Americans who are in the academic vanguard of their groups (offering a new interpretation of group differences in standardized test performance), that it causes disidentification with school, and that practices that reduce this threat can reduce these negative effects.},

Empathy comprises of emotional and cognitive components and may also be closely linked to sensorimotor processes, which go along with the motivation and behavior to respond compassionately to another person's feelings. There is growing evidence for local plastic change in the structure of the healthy adult human brain in response to environmental demands or intrinsic factors. Here we have investigated changes in brain structure resulting from or predisposing to empathy. Structural MRI data of 101 healthy adult females was analyzed. Empathy in fictitious as well as real-life situations was assessed using a validated self-evaluation measure. Furthermore, empathy-related structural effects were also put into the context of a functional map of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) determined by activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of previous functional imaging studies. We found that gray matter (GM) density in the left dorsal AIC correlates with empathy and that this area overlaps with the domain general region (DGR) of the anterior insula that is situated in-between functional systems involved in emotion{\textendash}cognition, pain, and motor tasks as determined by our meta-analysis. Thus, we propose that this insular region where we find structural differences depending on individual empathy may play a crucial role in modulating the efficiency of neural integration underlying emotional, cognitive, and sensorimotor information which is essential for global empathy.},

	abstract = {The increasing prevalence of congestive heart failure has focused importance on the search for potentially reversible etiologies of cardiomyopathy. The concept that incessant or chronic tachycardias can lead to ventricular dysfunction that is reversible is supported by both animal models of chronic rapid pacing as well as human studies documenting improvement in ventricular function with tachycardia rate or rhythm control. Sustained rapid pacing in experimental animal models can produce severe biventricular systolic dysfunction. Hemodynamic changes occur as soon as 24 h after rapid pacing, with continued deterioration in ventricular function for up to 3 to 5 weeks, resulting in end-stage heart failure. The recovery from pacing-induced cardiomyopathy demonstrates that the myopathic process associated with rapid heart rates is largely reversible. Within 48 h after termination of pacing, hemodynamic variables approach control levels, and left ventricular ejection fraction shows significant recovery with subsequent normalization after 1 to 2 weeks. In humans, descriptions of reversal of cardiomyopathy with rate or rhythm control of incessant or chronic tachycardias have been reported with atrial tachycardias, accessory pathway reciprocating tachycardias, atrioventricular (AV) node reentry and atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular responses. Control of AF rapid ventricular responses has been demonstrated to improve ventricular dysfunction with cardioversion to sinus rhythm, pharmacologic ventricular rate control and AV junction ablation and permanent ventricular pacing. The investigation of potential tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in patients with heart failure requires further prospective confirmation in larger numbers of patients, with study of mechanisms, patient groups affected and optimal therapies.

	abstract = {Purpose: To prospectively evaluate whether scar caused by radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the left atrium (LA) in patients with atrial fibrillation can be depicted with high-spatial-resolution delayed enhancement magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and Methods: All 23 subjects (16 men, seven women; mean age, 54 years {\textpm} 13 [standard deviation]) provided written informed consent; the study was approved by the local institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. A high-spatial-resolution free-breathing delayed enhancement MR imaging method was developed to detect scar (ie, ablated tissue) in the LA and pulmonary veins (PVs). The LA in 15 patients before ablation and in 18 patients at least 30 days after ablation was examined. A reader with 4 years of experience assessed presence of delayed enhancement on images and circumferential completeness. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were measured and compared with an unpaired t test. The relationship between measurements of enhancement thickness at the interatrial septum and the number of days after ablation was investigated. Results: No subject demonstrated preablation delayed enhancement of the atrial or PV wall, whereas postablation delayed enhancement was identified in all (100\%). In patients after ablation, a partial to completely circumferential delayed enhancement pattern could be identified for the left inferior PV that encompassed 88\% {\textpm} 11 of the circumference, but only 62\% of patients demonstrated more than 90\% circumferential delayed enhancement. The signal-to-noise ratio of blood was 12, and the signal-to-noise ratios of the pre- and postablation left atrial wall were 15 and 22, respectively (P {\textless} .05). A relationship between delayed enhancement wall thickness and the inverse of the time interval from ablation was identified (P {\textless} .05). Conclusion: High-spatial-resolution delayed enhancement MR imaging allows noninvasive identification of scar induced by RF ablation following isolation therapy of the PV. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2007},

A multiresolution implementation of the algorithm is performed using a wavelets basis and can be used to process both 2D and 3D data. In this work we focus on the adaptive character of the algorithm and we discuss how global and local statistics can be utilised in the segmentation process. We propose an improvement on the adaptivity by introducing an enhancement to control the adaptive properties of the segmentation process. This takes the form of a weighting function accounting for both local and global statistics, and is introduced in the minimisation. A new formulation of the segmentation problem allows us to control the effective contribution of each statistical component. The segmentation algorithm is demonstrated on synthetic data, 2D breast ultrasound data and on echocardiographic sequences (2D+T). An evaluation of the performance of the proposed algorithm is also presented.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) encompasses a variety of discrete clinical syndromes, including paroxysmal, chronic, acute, and postoperative. Digoxin, long considered the mainstay of therapy for rate control in all types of AF, appears to have only modest electrophysiologic effects, which are mediated primarily by the autonomic nervous system. Digoxin has less potency than the calcium antagonists or $\beta$-blocking drugs with respect to atrioventricular nodal blockade. Although less potent than calcium antagonists or $\beta$-blocking drugs on the atrioventricular node, digoxin provides positive inotropic support, whereas the other 2 agents can suppress left ventricular function. Thus, digoxin is the agent of choice in patients with AF in the setting of significant left ventricular dysfunction. However, in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction, digoxin should be considered second-line therapy for the treatment of all AF syndromes.},

The non-parametric statistics of Mann-Whitney and Kolmogorov-Smirnov can be immediately identified on this plot. Local non-parametric confidence interval procedures related to the theoretical ROC curve are briefly reviewed. For continuous data, two new simultaneous confidence regions associated with the ROC curve are presented, one based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov confidence bands for distribution functions and the other based on bootstrapping. Two different tests on the same patients can be compared on the ROC scale. For continuous data, one important problem concerns the comparison of two ROC plots (as would arise from two correlated diagnostic tests on each patient) using a sup norm (this metric can detect differences that the ROC area cannot). The distribution of a statistic based on this norm is studied, using the bootstrap. A biomedical example illustrates the methodologies.},

However, currently available 3D speckle-tracking echocardiographic methods are based on different algorithms, which introduce substantial differences between them and make them not interchangeable with each other. Therefore, it is critical that each 3D speckle-tracking echocardiographic method is validated individually before being introduced into clinical practice.

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash} Atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently complicates congestive heart failure (CHF). However, the electrophysiological substrate for AF in humans with CHF remains unknown. We evaluated the electrophysiological and electroanatomic characteristics of the atria in patients with CHF.
Methods and Results{\textemdash} Twenty-one patients (aged 53.7{\textpm}13.6 years) with symptomatic CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction 25.5{\textpm}6.0\%) and 21 age-matched controls were studied. The following were evaluated: effective refractory periods (ERPs) from the high and low lateral right atrium (LRA), high septal right atrium, and distal coronary sinus (CS); conduction time along the CS and LRA; corrected sinus node recovery times; P-wave duration; and conduction at the crista terminalis. In a subset, electroanatomic mapping was performed to determine atrial activation, regional conduction velocity, double potentials, fractionated electrograms, regional voltage, and areas of electrical silence. Patients with CHF demonstrated an increase in atrial ERP with no change in the heterogeneity of refractoriness, an increase of atrial conduction time along the LRA and the CS, prolongation of the P-wave duration and corrected sinus node recovery times, and greater number and duration of double potentials along the crista terminalis. Electroanatomic mapping demonstrated regional conduction slowing with a greater number of electrograms with fractionation or double potentials, associated with areas of low voltage and electrical silence (scar). Patients with CHF demonstrated an increased propensity for AF with single extrastimuli, and induced AF was more often sustained.
Conclusions{\textemdash} Atrial remodeling due to CHF is characterized by structural changes, abnormalities of conduction, sinus node dysfunction, and increased refractoriness. These abnormalities may be responsible in part for the increased propensity for AF in CHF.},

	abstract = {Background
The Cox Maze procedure has been used to treat atrial fibrillation in patients with mitral valve disease. Recently, ectopic foci, originating in the pulmonary veins, were demonstrated in patients with atrial fibrillation, and the indication was that their arrhythmia could have a focal origin. In the light of this new evidence, a simplified surgical technique to isolate the pulmonary veins was developed to eliminate permanent atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. This study compares three surgical procedures proposed to maintain sinus rhythm after mitral valve surgery.
Methods
A prospective clinical trial of 30 patients with mitral valve disease and permanent atrial fibrillation who had undergone mitral valve surgery were randomized in accordance with the type of surgery used on each: (1) associated en bloc isolation of pulmonary veins, (2) the Maze procedure, or (3) mitral valve correction alone. The preoperative clinical characteristics were similar in the three groups.
Results
The overall postoperative complications were similar in all three groups. The cardiopulmonary bypass time and the aortic cross-clamping time were shorter in the control group, but this factor bore no relation to increased morbidity in the intervention groups. The relative risk of atrial fibrillation after surgery was 0.08 in the group undergoing isolation of pulmonary veins (p = 0.010; 95\% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.71) and 0.20 in the Maze group (p = 0.044; 95\% confidence interval, 0.04 to 1.02) compared with the control group.
Conclusions
En bloc isolation of pulmonary veins associated with mitral valve surgery appears to be safe and just as effective as the Maze procedure in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation.},

	abstract = {X-ray exposure during radiologically guided interventional procedures may have some deleterious effects. The aim of our study was to analyse the factors affecting patient dose during percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA). We evaluated radiation dose during coronary angiography followed by one-vessel PTCA in 402 consecutive patients who were treated by three experienced physicians using both femoral and radial techniques. Fluoroscopy time (t) and patient dose measured by a dose-area product (DAP) meter were recorded. A good correlation was observed between t and the DAP (r=0.78, p{\textless}0.001). To assess the factors affecting radiation exposure, we studied the differences between operators, arterial catheterization access and stenting strategy. Median (25th to 75th percentiles) values for t were 19 (13 to 26) min and for DAP were 191 (145 to 256) Gy cm2 for operator 3 compared with t=12 (9 to 18) min and DAP=137 (91 to 208) Gy cm2 for operator 2 (p{\textless}0.005 versus operator 3) and t=13 (9 to 17) min, and DAP=134 (93 to 190) Gy cm2 for operator 1 (p{\textless}0.001 versus operator 3). Differences between the radial and the femoral techniques were: t=17 (13 to 24) min versus 12 (8 to 17) min, (p{\textless}0.001) and DAP=175 (128 to 246) Gy cm2 versus 138 (93 to 197) Gy cm2, (p{\textless}0.001). In comparison with stenting without pre-dilation, direct stenting significantly reduced t and DAP [t=12 (9 to 16) min versus 16 (11 to 22) min, (p{\textless}0.001) and DAP=130 (95 to 186) Gy cm2 versus 163 (119 to 230) Gy cm2, respectively, (p{\textless}0.01)]. Radiation exposure to patients and staff are strongly dependent on operators, stenting strategy and the arterial access chosen for ad hoc one-vessel PTCA.},

However, recent prevalence and projected future numbers of persons with atrial fibrillation are not well described. Objective To estimate prevalence of atrial fibrillation and US national projections of the numbers of persons with atrial fibrillation through the year 2050. Design, Setting, and Patients Cross-sectional study of adults aged 20 years or older who were enrolled in a large health maintenance organization in California and who had atrial fibrillation diagnosed between July 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997. Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of atrial fibrillation in the study population of 1.89 million; projected number of persons in the United States with atrial fibrillation between 1995-2050. Results A total of 17 974 adults with diagnosed atrial fibrillation were identified during the study period; 45\% were aged 75 years or older. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 0.95\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.94\%-0.96\%). Atrial fibrillation was more common in men than in women (1.1\% vs 0.8\%; P{\textless}.001). Prevalence increased from 0.1\% among adults younger than 55 years to 9.0\% in persons aged 80 years or older. Among persons aged 50 years or older, prevalence of atrial fibrillation was higher in whites than in blacks (2.2\% vs 1.5\%; P{\textless}.001). We estimate approximately 2.3 million US adults currently have atrial fibrillation. We project that this will increase to more than 5.6 million (lower bound, 5.0; upper bound, 6.3) by the year 2050, with more than 50\% of affected individuals aged 80 years or older. Conclusions Our study confirms that atrial fibrillation is common among older adults and provides a contemporary basis for estimates of prevalence in the United States. The number of patients with atrial fibrillation is likely to increase 2.5-fold during the next 50 years, reflecting the growing proportion of elderly individuals. Coordinated efforts are needed to face the increasing challenge of optimal stroke prevention and rhythm management in patients with atrial fibrillation.},

The duration of fluoroscopic exposure decreased from 50 (standard deviation [SD] 21) minutes in the first 3 months to 40 (SD 15) minutes in the last 3 months (p {\textless} 0.05). Complications occurred in 3.5\% of the patients; they included hemopericardium, cerebral embolism, perforation of the right atrial wall, air embolism in a coronary artery and hematoma at the arterial perforation site. None of the complications resulted in death. CONCLUSIONS: With experience, radiofrequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways can have an overall success rate of more than 95\% and a complication rate of less than 4\%. Such rates make this procedure suitable for first-line therapy for patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.},

The geometry of the acoustic window along with circular Hough transform and image statistics is used to robustly identify the region of interest, which encloses left ventricle, irrespective of image quality and level of left ventricle at which image was acquired. Again in the region of interest, left ventricle center point (LVCP) was identified by image statistics. The approximate LV border was detected by radial gradient search with magnitude as well as direction and then smoothing it locally and temporally. The results were validated by comparing computer generated boundaries to those manually outlined by one expert on ten data sets each containing 28 frames over full cardiac cycle. The mean error in the boundaries was plusmn2 mm. Directional radial gradient search along with temporal constraints from adjacent frames gives a better initial estimate of the LV boundary. The contour for each of the frame so obtained may serve a good initialization to optimize it by automated methods based on active contours.},

	abstract = {The controversy as to whether Doppler ultrasonic methods should play a role in clinical decision-making in the prevention of stroke is attributable to reported disagreement between angiographic and ultrasonic results and the lack of internationally accepted ultrasound criteria for describing the degree of stenosis. Foremost among the explanations for both is the broad scatter of peak systolic velocities in the stenosis, the criterion that has so far received most attention. Grading based on a set of main and additional criteria can overcome diagnostic errors. Morphological measurements (B-mode images and color flow imaging) are the main criteria for low and moderate degrees of stenosis. Increased velocities in the stenosis indicate narrowing, but the appearance of collateral flow and decreased poststenotic flow velocity prove a high degree stenosis (>=70\%), additionally allowing the estimation of the hemodynamic effect in the category of high-degree stenosis. Additional criteria refer to the effect of a stenosis on prestenotic flow (common carotid artery), the extent of poststenotic flow disturbances, and derived velocity criteria (diastolic peak velocity and the carotid ratio). This multiparametric approach is intended to increase the reliability and the standard of reporting of ultrasonic results for arteriosclerotic disease of the carotid artery.},

	abstract = {A 24 hour electrocardiographic recording was performed before hospital discharge in 430 patients who survived the cardiac care unit phase of acute myocardial infarction. Fifty patients (11.6 percent) had ventricular tachycardia, that is, three or more consecutive ventricular complexes. In 25 (50 percent) of these 50 patients, there was only one episode of ventricular tachycardia and, in 15 patients (30 percent), the longest run of ventricular tachycardia was only three consecutive ventricular premature depolarizations. The average rate of tachycardia was 119/min. Tachycardia rarely started with R on T ventricular premature complexes (4 of 1,370 episodes in 50 patients).
There was no difference between the groups with and without ventricular tachycardia with respect to age and sex, but the patients with tachycardia had a significantly greater prevalence of previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular failure in the cardiac care unit, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation in the cardiac care unit and significantly more frequent use of digitalis and diuretic and antiarrhythmic drugs at the time of hospital discharge.
The group with tachycardia had a 38.0 percent 1 year mortality rate compared with the rate of 11.6 percent in the group without tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia had a strong association with 1 year mortality (odds ratio = 4.7). Although ventricular tachycardia had a significant association with many other postinfarction risk factors, it was still significantly associated with the 1 year mortality (p {\textless} 0.05) when other important risk variables were controlled statistically using a multiple logistic regression model. The 36 month cumulative mortality rate was 54.0 percent in the group with ventricular tachycardia compared with 19.4 percent in the group without tachycardia.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash} The aim of this study was to clarify the role of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) alone versus left atrial linear lesions in the treatment of permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with left atrial dilatation and valvular disease. The primary end point was to assess the persistence of sinus rhythm (SR) off antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) at 2-year follow-up and to correlate clinical outcome with surgical results validated with electroanatomic mapping (EAM).
Methods and Results{\textemdash} A total of 105 patients with permanent AF undergoing valve surgery were assigned to 3 different groups: in groups {\textquotedblleft}U{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}7,{\textquotedblright} left atrial linear cryoablation was performed, whereas in group {\textquotedblleft}PV{\textquotedblright} patients, anatomic cryoisolation of pulmonary veins only was performed. In groups U and 7, SR was achieved in 57\% of patients, whereas it was achieved in 20\% of PV patients during 2-year follow-up. In the first 51 patients, the ablation schemes were validated with EAM. The EAM showed that the U lesion was never obtained: in 59\% of these patients, a complete 7 lesion was achieved instead; in the 7 group, a complete 7 lesion was present in 65\% of patients, whereas a complete PVI was obtained in 71\% of patients. Considering patients in whom a complete 7 lesion was demonstrated with the EAM, SR without AADs was achieved in 86\% of patients, whereas only 25\% of patients with complete PVI were in SR without AADs.
Conclusions{\textemdash} In patients with permanent AF, left atrial dilatation and valvular heart disease linear lesions in the posterior region of the left atrium are more effective than PVI alone. With cryoablation, the surgical intent is fulfilled in only approximately 65\% of the cases. Knowing the real anatomic and electrophysiological effects of surgical ablation is necessary to correctly interpret the clinical outcome.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash} In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the risk of thromboembolic events (TEs) is variable and is influenced by the presence and number of comorbid conditions. The effect of percutaneous left atrial radiofrequency ablation (LARFA) of AF on the risk of TEs is unclear.
Methods and Results{\textemdash} LARFA was performed in 755 consecutive patients with paroxysmal (n=490) or chronic (n=265) AF. Four hundred eleven patients (56\%) had >=1 risk factor for stroke. All patients were anticoagulated with warfarin for >=3 months after LARFA. A TE occurred in 7 patients (0.9\%) within 2 weeks of LARFA. A late TE occurred 6 to 10 months after ablation in 2 patients (0.2\%), 1 of whom still had AF, despite therapeutic anticoagulation in both. Among 522 patients who remained in sinus rhythm after LARFA, warfarin was discontinued in 79\% of 256 patients without risk factors and in 68\% of 266 patients with >=1 risk factor. Patients older than 65 years or with a history of stroke were more likely to remain anticoagulated despite a successful outcome from LARFA. None of the patients in whom anticoagulation was discontinued had a TE during 25{\textpm}8 months of follow-up.
Conclusions{\textemdash} The risk of a TE after LARFA is 1.1\%, with most events occurring within 2 weeks after the procedure. Discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy appears to be safe after successful LARFA, both in patients without risk factors for stroke and in patients with risk factors other than age {\textgreater}65 years and history of stroke. Sufficient safety data are as yet unavailable to support discontinuation of anticoagulation in patients older than 65 years or with a history of stroke.},

MR thermometry at 1.5 T using the proton resonance frequency (PRF) method was assessed in 10 healthy volunteers under normal breathing conditions, using a multi-slice, ECG-gated, echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence in combination with slice tracking. Temperature images were post-processed to remove residual motion-related artifacts. Using an MR-compatible steerable catheter and electromagnetic noise filter, RF ablation was performed in the ventricles of two sheep in vivo. The standard deviation of the temperature evolution in time (TSD) was computed. Temperature mapping of the left ventricle was achieved at an update rate of approximately 1 Hz with a mean TSD of 3.6 {\textpm} 0.9 {\textdegree}C. TSD measurements at the septum showed a higher precision (2.8 {\textpm} 0.9 {\textdegree}C) than at the myocardial regions at the heart{\textendash}lung and heart{\textendash}liver interfaces (4.1 {\textpm} 0.9 {\textdegree}C). Temperature rose maximally by 9 {\textdegree}C and 16 {\textdegree}C during 5 W and 10 W RF applications, respectively, for 60 s each. Tissue temperature can be monitored at an update rate of approximately 1 Hz in five slices. Typical temperature changes observed during clinical RF application can be monitored with an acceptable level of precision. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The impact of nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on stroke incidence was examined in 5,070 participants in the Framingham Study after 34 years of follow-up. Compared with subjects free of these conditions, the age-adjusted incidence of stroke was more than doubled in the presence of coronary heart disease (p less than 0.001) and more than trebled in the presence of hypertension (p less than 0.001). There was a more than fourfold excess of stroke in subjects with cardiac failure (p less than 0.001) and a near fivefold excess when atrial fibrillation was present (p less than 0.001). In persons with coronary heart disease or cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation doubled the stroke risk in men and trebled the risk in women. With increasing age the effects of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on the risk of stroke became progressively weaker (p less than 0.05). Advancing age, however, did not reduce the significant impact of atrial fibrillation. For persons aged 80-89 years, atrial fibrillation was the sole cardiovascular condition to exert an independent effect on stroke incidence (p less than 0.001). The attributable risk of stroke for all cardiovascular contributors decreased with age except for atrial fibrillation, for which the attributable risk increased significantly (p less than 0.01), rising from 1.5\% for those aged 50-59 years to 23.5\% for those aged 80-89 years. While these findings highlight the impact of each cardiovascular condition on the risk of stroke, the data suggest that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to stroke when atrial fibrillation is present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Advances in the capabilities of imaging modalities and the increasing cost of healthcare warrant a review of the multimodality approach.

This review discusses the application of cardiac imaging for pulmonary vein and left atrial ablation divided into stages: pre-procedural stage (assessment of left atrial dimensions, left atrial appendage thrombus and pulmonary vein anatomy), peri-procedural stage (integration of anatomical and electrical information) and post-procedural stage (evaluation of efficacy by assessment of tissue properties). Each section is dedicated to one of the subtopics of a stage, allowing a thorough comparison to be made between the strengths and weaknesses of the different imaging modalities and the identification of one that exhibits the potential for a single technique approach.},

However, little is known about the effects of chronic atrial fibrillation on atrial electrophysiology and its recovery course in humans. Methods and results: Nineteen patients, mean age 64{\textpm}14 years, with chronic atrial fibrillation of more than six months duration were included in this study. All of them were successfully converted to sinus rhythm with an external defibrillator. Atrial effective refractory periods at right atrial appendage and distal coronary sinus were determined with five pacing cycle lengths (300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 ms) at 30 min after cardioversion and once a day for four days. The atrial conduction properties, including P wave duration of surface ECG, and right and left atrial conduction times, were also measured at the same time interval. Twenty age-matched patients without a history of atrial tachyarrhythmia were evaluated as controls. In comparison with controls, chronic atrial fibrillation significantly shortened the atrial effective refractory period, impaired its rate adaptation response, especially at distal coronary sinus, and depressed the conduction properties of atria. The atrial conduction properties did not change during the four-day follow-up period; however, the atrial effective refractory period was gradually prolonged and its rate adaptation response improved after restoration of sinus rhythm. Conclusions: In humans, chronic atrial fibrillation significantly shortened the atrial effective refractory period, and impaired its rate adaptation response. Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm could reverse these electrophysiological changes.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The aim of this study was to perform a head-to-head comparison between multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients with an intermediate likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) and to compare non-invasive findings to invasive coronary angiography.Background
Multi-slice computed tomography detects atherosclerosis, whereas MPI detects ischemia; how these 2 techniques compare in patients with an intermediate likelihood of CAD is unknown.Methods
A total of 114 patients, mainly with intermediate likelihood of CAD, underwent both MSCT and MPI. The MSCT studies were classified as having no CAD, nonobstructive ({\textless}50\% luminal narrowing) CAD, or obstructive CAD. Myocardial perfusion imaging examinations were classified as showing normal or abnormal (reversible and/or fixed defects). In a subset of 58 patients, invasive coronary angiography was performed.Results
On the basis of the MSCT data, 41 patients (36\%) were classified as having no CAD, of whom 90\% had normal MPI. A total of 33 patients (29\%) showed non-obstructive CAD, whereas at least 1 significant ({\textgreater}=50\% luminal narrowing) lesion was observed in the remaining 40 patients (35\%). Only 45\% of patients with an abnormal MSCT had abnormal MPI; even in patients with obstructive CAD on MSCT, 50\% still had a normal MPI. In the subset of patients undergoing invasive angiography, the agreement with MSCT was excellent (90\%).Conclusions
Myocardial perfusion imaging and MSCT provide different and complementary information on CAD, namely, detection of atherosclerosis versus detection of ischemia. As compared to invasive angiography, MSCT has a high accuracy for detecting CAD in patients with an intermediate likelihood of CAD.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and test an automatic free-breathing, delayed enhancement imaging method with improved image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proposed approach uses free-breathing, inversion-recovery single-shot fast imaging with steady precession (FISP) delayed-enhancement with respiratory motion compensation based on nonrigid image registration. Motion-corrected averaging is used to enhance SNR. RESULTS: Fully automatic, nonrigid registration was compared to previously validated rigid body registration that required user interaction. The performance was measured using the variance of edge positions in intensity profiles through the myocardial infarction (MI) enhanced region and through the right ventricular (RV) wall. Measured variation of the MI edge was 1.16 +/- 0.71 mm (N = 6 patients; mean +/- SD) for rigid body and 1.08 +/- 0.76 mm for nonrigid registration (no significant difference). On the other hand, significant improvement (P {\textless} 0.005) was found in the measurements at the RV edge where the SD was 2.06 +/- 0.56 mm for rigid body and 0.59 +/- 0.22 mm for nonrigid registration. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach achieves delayed enhancement images with high resolution and SNR without requiring a breathhold. Motion correction of free-breathing delayed-enhancement imaging using nonrigid image registration may be implemented in a fully automatic fashion and performs uniformly well across the full field of view (FOV).},

	abstract = {Background: Despite an overall decline in age adjusted mortality from coronary heart disease in developed countries, the number of patients with heart failure may be increasing.
Objective: To project the future burden of heart failure in Scotland from contemporary epidemiological data.
Methods: Scotland, like many industrialised countries, has an aging though numerically stable population (5.1 million). Current estimates of prevalence, general practice (GP) consultation rates, and hospital admission rates related to heart failure were applied to the whole Scottish population. These estimates were then projected over the period 2000 to 2020, on an age and sex specific basis, using expected changes in the age structure of the Scottish population.
Results: There are currently estimated to be 40 000 men and 45 000 women aged >= 45 years with heart failure in Scotland. On the basis of population changes alone, these figures will rise in men and women by 2300 (6\%) and 1500 (3\%) by year 2005, and by 12 300 (31\%) and 7800 (17\%) in the longer term (2020), respectively. On the same basis, the annual number of male and female GP visits is likely to rise by 6400 (6\%) and 2500 (2\%) by year 2005, and by 35 200 (40\%) and 17 300 (16\%) in the longer term (124 000 and 126 000 visits), respectively. In the year 2000 about 3500 men and 4300 women in Scotland had an incident hospital admission for heart failure. By the year 2020 these figures are likely to increase by 52\% (1800 more) and 16\% (717 more) in men and women, respectively. If recent trends in short term case fatality rates continue to improve, the number of men who survive this event will increase by 59\% (1700 more). Overall, by 2020 the annual number of male and female hospital admissions associated with a principal diagnosis of heart failure is expected to increase by 34\% (from 5500 to 7500) and by 12\% (from 7800 to 8500), respectively.
Conclusions: Unless rapid and major changes occur in the incidence of heart failure, the burden of this disorder will continue to increase in both primary and secondary care over the next two decades. The greatest increase is likely to occur in men. Future health service planning must take this into account.},

However, many patients have contraindications to ceMRI. Previous studies have shown that contrast enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (ceMDCT) can visualize focal scars following myocardial infarction in experimental animals and patients. The purpose of this manuscript is to assess the ability of ceMDCT to detect focal myocardial scars in patients with HCM. Twelve HCM patients underwent ceMRI and ceMDCT. Fibrotic areas of myocardium were defined as focal or diffuse areas of fibrosis. The mean signal intensity in ceMRI and attenuation values in ceMDCT of the fibrotic regions, normal myocardium and left ventricle blood pool contrast were measured using qualitative and quantitative analysis. Focal scar mass was calculated using both techniques. Focal scars were detected in 9 patients and diffuse fibrosis was visualized in all patients by ceMRI. Differences between normalized SI of normal myocardium and focal scars, normal and diffuse areas of fibrosis, and diffuse fibrosis and focal scars were significant for both ceMRI and ceMDCT (p {\textless} 0.05). Diffuse fibrosis was poorly visualized by ceMDCT but was detectable using quantitative measurements. CeMDCT has potential to detect focal myocardial scars in patients with HCM who have contraindications to ceMRI study. However, ceMDCT does not enable adequate visualization of diffuse myocardial fibrosis, and thus is less well suited than ceMRI for assessment of total burden of fibrosis. This limitation may be overcome using quantitative methodology.},

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, which is associated with a high risk of stroke and thromboembolism. Increasing evidence suggests that the thrombogenic tendency in atrial fibrillation is related to several underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Abnormal changes in flow are evident by stasis in the left atrium, and seen as spontaneous echocontrast. Abnormal changes in vessel walls{\textemdash}essentially, anatomical and structural defects{\textemdash}include progressive atrial dilatation, endocardial denudation, and oedematous or fibroelastic infiltration of the extracellular matrix. Additionally, abnormal changes in blood constituents are well described, and include haemostatic and platelet activation, as well as inflammation and growth factor changes. These changes result in the fulfilment of Virchow's triad for thrombogenesis, and accord with a prothrombotic or hypercoagulable state in this arrhythmia. In this Review, we present an overview of the established and purported mechanisms for thrombogenesis in atrial fibrillation.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional ultrasound (US) is widely used in minimally invasive cardiac procedures due to its convenience of use and noninvasive nature. However, the low quality of US images often limits their utility as a means for guiding procedures, since it is often difficult to relate the images to their anatomical context. To improve the interpretability of the US images while maintaining US as a flexible anatomical and functional real-time imaging modality, we describe a multimodality image navigation system that integrates 2D US images with their 3D context by registering them to high quality preoperative models based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) images. The mapping from such a model to the patient is completed using spatial and temporal registrations. Spatial registration is performed by a two-step rapid registration method that first approximately aligns the two images as a starting point to an automatic registration procedure. Temporal alignment is performed with the aid of electrocardiograph (ECG) signals and a latency compensation method. Registration accuracy is measured by calculating the TRE. Results show that the error between the US and preoperative images of a beating heart phantom is 1.7 +/-0.4 mm, with a similar performance being observed in in vivo animal experiments.},

	abstract = {Prior to performing a robot-assisted coronary artery bypass grafting procedure, a pre-operative computed tomography scan is used to assess patient candidacy and to identify the location of the target vessel. The surgeon then determines the optimal port locations to ensure proper reach to the target with the robotic instruments, while assuming that the heart does not undergo any significant changes between the pre- and intra-operative stages. However, the peri-operative workflow itself leads to changes in heart position and consequently the intra-operative target vessel location. As such, the pre-operative plan must be adequately updated to adjust the target vessel location to better suit the intraoperative condition. Here we propose a technique to predict the position of the peri-operative target vessel location with approximately 3.5 mm RMS accuracy. We believe this technique will potentially reduce the rate of conversion of robot-assisted procedures to traditional open-chest surgery due to poor planning.},

Voltage mapping is an important tool for characterizing proarrhythmic electrophysiological substrate, yet it is subject to geometric factors that influence bipolar amplitudes and thus compromise performance. The aim of this study was to characterize the impact of catheter orientation on the ability of bipolar amplitudes to accurately discriminate between healthy and diseased tissues.


Methods and Results

We constructed a 3-dimensional, in silico, bidomain model of cardiac tissue containing transmural lesions of varying diameter. A planar excitation wave was stimulated and electrograms were sampled with a realistic catheter model at multiple positions and orientations. We carried out validation studies in animal experiments of acute ablation lesions mapped with a clinical mapping system. Bipolar electrograms sampled at higher inclination angles of the catheter with respect to the tissue demonstrated improvements in both sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection. Removing low-voltage electrograms with concurrent activation of both electrodes, suggesting false attenuation of the bipolar electrogram due to alignment with the excitation wavefront, had little effect on the accuracy of voltage mapping.


Conclusions

Our results demonstrate possible mechanisms for the impact of catheter orientation on voltage mapping accuracy. Moreover, results from our simulations suggest that mapping accuracy may be improved by selectively controlling the inclination of the catheter to record at higher angles with respect to the tissue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND

The safety and clinical utility of MRI at 1.5 T in patients with cardiac implantable devices such as pacemakers (PM) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) have been reported. This study aims to evaluate the extent of artifacts on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with PM and ICD (PM/ICD).


METHODS AND RESULTS

A total of 71 CMR studies were performed with an established safety protocol in patients with prepectoral PM/ICD. The artifact area around the PM/ICD generator was measured in all short-axis (SA), horizontal (HLA), and vertical long-axis (VLA) SSFP cine planes. The location and extent of artifacts were also assessed in all SA (20 sectors per plane), HLA, and VLA (6 sectors per plane) late gadolinium-enhanced CMR (LGE-CMR) planes. The artifact area on cine CMR was significantly larger with ICD versus PM generators in each plane (P{\textless}0.001, respectively). In patients with left-sided ICD or biventricular ICD systems, the percentages of sectors with any artifacts on LGE-CMR were 53.7\%, 48.0\%, and 49.2\% in SA, HLA, and VLA planes, respectively. Patients with left-sided PM or right-sided PM/ICD had fewer artifacts. Anterior and apical regions were severely affected by artifact caused by left-sided PM/ICD generators.


CONCLUSIONS

In contrast to patients with right-sided PM/ICD and left-sided PM, the anterior and apical left ventricle can be affected by susceptibility artifacts in patients with left-sided ICD. Artifact reduction methodologies will be necessary to improve the performance of CMR in patients with left sided ICD systems.},

The concept of dual pathway physiology remains useful, although this physiology likely results from the functional properties of anisotropic tissue within the triangle of Koch, rather than anatomically distinct tracts of conduction. Also, there remains debate regarding whether the critical reentrant circuit path requires participation of the atrium. In our opinion, current evidence favors functional anisotropic reentry limited to the subatrial tissues as the arrhythmia mechanism. Reasons for this are reviewed. Fortunately, typical AVNRT is readily amenable to definitive therapy by catheter-based radiofrequency energy delivery at the so-called slow pathway region located at the posterior Triangle of Koch. Anterior or left-sided approaches are very rarely indicated. Results from multiple series have shown this strategy to be both safe and effective, therefore ablation therapy should now be considered as the definitive therapy of choice for the majority of patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Unlike the initial balloon ablation catheters that were designed to deliver ablation lesions within the pulmonary veins (PVs), the current balloon prototypes are fashioned to deliver lesions at the PV ostia.
Objective
Using electroanatomical mapping, this study evaluates the actual location of ablation lesions generated by cryo-based, laser-based, or ultrasound-based balloon catheters.
Methods
In a total of 14 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, PV isolation was performed using either a cryoballoon catheter (8 patients), laser catheter (4 patients) or ultrasound balloon catheter (2 patients). Patients underwent preprocedural computed tomographic/magnetic resonance imaging. An intracardiac ultrasound catheter was used to aid in positioning the balloon catheter at the PV ostium/antrum. In all patients, sinus rhythm bipolar voltage amplitude maps (using either CARTO with computed tomographic/magnetic resonance image integration or NavX mapping) were generated at baseline and after electrical PV isolation as confirmed by use of a circular mapping catheter.
Results
Electrical isolation was achieved in 100\% of the PVs. Electroanatomical mapping revealed that after ablation with any of the 3 balloon catheters, the extent of isolation included the tubular portions of each PV to the level of the PV ostia. However, the PV antral portions were left largely unablated with all 3 balloon technologies.
Conclusion
Using the current generation of balloon ablation catheters, electrical isolation occurs at the level of the PV ostia, but the antral regions are largely unablated.},

A one-dimensional system, however, only visualizes structures lying along a single straight line. The spatial relationships of the various cardiac structures are therefore not so easily defined as with two-dimensional systems which display the heart by constructing a plane image composed of many straight lines. We have developed a sector scanning system for obtaining two-dimensional echocardiograms in real time using ultrasonic pulse-echo techniques. Images are produced by angling rapidly a single transducer through a 30-degree sector from a fixed spot (between ribs) on the patient's chest. Thirty complete sectors (or frames) are produced per second. The use of a large diameter transducer ensures that signal strength is good and cardiac structures, including endocardium, can be visualized. Other advantages include high transducer sensitivity, real time imaging and easy visualization of various regions of the heart. Experience with more than 100 patients indicates that diagnostic quality two-dimensional echocardiograms can be readily obtained in essentially the same patients from whom one-dimensional echocardiograms are recorded and can usually be performed in less time.},

This serves as the foundation of a fully automatic registration, that aligns a 3D ultrasound sweep with the corresponding tomographic modality using a rigid or an affine transformation model, without any manual interaction. These techniques were evaluated in a study involving 25 patients with indeterminate lesions in liver and kidney. The clinical setup, acquisition and registration workflow is described, along with the evaluation of the registration accuracy with respect to physician-defined Ground Truth. Our new algorithm correctly registers without any manual interaction in 76\% of the cases, the average RMS TRE over multiple target lesions throughout the liver is 8.1mm.},

	abstract = {Background
A large proportion of patients with heart failure (HF) have a large and poorly contracting left ventricle. The noninvasive recognition of the ischemic etiology of such patients is difficult, and for this purpose, usually patients undergo coronary angiography. It has been shown that cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can detect myocardial scarring by evaluating late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). The diagnostic accuracy of such method in differentiating the etiology of HF has not been previously tested in an unselected HF ambulatory population.
Methods
We studied 60 ambulatory patients consecutively enrolled from a specialized HF clinic. We included HF patients who were found to have increased left ventricular (LV) dimensions and reduced function. CMR was performed in these patients by operators who were unaware of patients' history and clinical conditions. LV dimensions and global and regional function, as well as the pattern of LGE, were obtained in each subject. Coronary angiography was subsequently performed in all the patients. The diagnostic accuracy of clinical history and electrocardiographic patterns, as well as regional wall motion abnormalities, wall thinning, and LGE, in differentiating coronary artery disease (CAD) from non-CAD patients were evaluated.
Results
The majority of CAD patients (98\%) showed LV contrast hyperenhancement with respect to non-CAD HF subjects (16\%). The detection of LGE by CMR had a sensitivity of 98\% and a specificity of 84\% and an overall accuracy of 93\% in detecting CAD etiology among HF patients.
Conclusions
LGE is able to accurately differentiate CAD from non-CAD etiology of HF and may represent a clinically useful noninvasive tool for this purpose. As it provides relevant functional information as well as insight into the etiology, CMR may be included among the most important diagnostic tools in the workup of patients with HF.},

Currently, the major interventional specialties are interventional (or vascular) radiology, interventional cardiology, and endovascular surgical (interventional) neuroradiology. All three are perfecting the use of stents and other procedures to keep diseased arteries open, while also evaluating the application these procedures. The rapid new development of imaging technologies, mechanical devices, and types of treatment, while certainly beneficial to the patient, can also lead to ambiguity regarding specific specialty claims on certain techniques and devices. While these practitioners can be in competition with each other, cooperation and communication are the most advantageous methods to deal with these "turf wars."

	abstract = {Real-time 3D echocardiography (RT3DE) promises a more objective and complete cardiac functional analysis by dynamic 3D image acquisition. Despite several efforts towards automation of left ventricle (LV) segmentation and tracking, these remain challenging research problems due to the poor-quality nature of acquired images usually containing missing anatomical information, speckle noise, and limited field-of-view (FOV). Recently, multi-view fusion 3D echocardiography has been introduced as acquiring multiple conventional single-view RT3DE images with small probe movements and fusing them together after alignment. This concept of multi-view fusion helps to improve image quality and anatomical information and extends the FOV. We now take this work further by comparing single-view and multi-view fused images in a systematic study. In order to better illustrate the differences, this work evaluates image quality and information content of single-view and multi-view fused images using image-driven LV endocardial segmentation and tracking. The image-driven methods were utilized to fully exploit image quality and anatomical information present in the image, thus purposely not including any high-level constraints like prior shape or motion knowledge in the analysis approaches. Experiments show that multi-view fused images are better suited for LV segmentation and tracking, while relatively more failures and errors were observed on single-view images.},

	abstract = {Objectives
This study describes 5-year follow-up results of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).
Background
Long-term efficacy following catheter ablation of AF remains unknown.
Methods
A total of 100 patients (86 men, 14 women), age 55.7 {\textpm} 9.6 years, referred to our center for a first AF ablation (63\% paroxysmal; 3.5 {\textpm} 1.4 prior ineffective antiarrhythmic agents) were followed for 5 years. Complete success was defined as absence of any AF or atrial tachycardia recurrence (clinical or by 24-h Holter monitoring) lasting >=30 s.
Results
Arrhythmia-free survival rates after a single catheter ablation procedure were 40\%, 37\%, and 29\% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively, with most recurrences over the first 6 months. Patients with long-standing persistent AF experienced a higher recurrence rate than those with paroxysmal or persistent forms (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.9, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0 to 3.5; p = 0.0462). In all, 175 procedures were performed, with a median of 2 per patient. Arrhythmia-free survival following the last catheter ablation procedure was 87\%, 81\%, and 63\% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Valvular heart disease (HR: 6.0, 95\% CI: 2.0 to 17.6; p = 0.0012) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (HR: 34.0, 95\% CI: 6.3 to 182.1; p \&lt; 0.0001) independently predicted recurrences. Major complications (cardiac tamponade requiring drainage) occurred in 3 patients (3\%).
Conclusions
In selected patients with AF, a catheter ablation strategy with repeat intervention as necessary provides acceptable long-term relief. Although most recurrences transpire over the first 6 to 12 months, a slow but steady decline in arrhythmia-free survival is noted thereafter.},

	abstract = {A new approach to the problem of multimodality medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method that uses the level sets of volumes to reconstruct the shapes of 3D objects from range data. The strategy is to formulate 3D reconstruction as a statistical problem: find that surface which is mostly likely, given the data and some prior knowledge about the application domain. The resulting optimization problem is solved by an incremental process of deformation. We represent a deformable surface as the level set of a discretely sampled scalar function of three dimensions, i.e., a volume. Such level-set models have been shown to mimic conventional deformable surface models by encoding surface movements as changes in the greyscale values of the volume. The result is a voxel-based modeling technology that offers several advantages over conventional parametric models, including flexible topology, no need for reparameterization, concise descriptions of differential structure, and a natural scale space for hierarchical representations. This paper builds on previous work in both 3D reconstruction and level-set modeling. It presents a fundamental result in surface estimation from range data: an analytical characterization of the surface that maximizes the posterior probability. It also presents a novel computational technique for level-set modeling, called the sparse-field algorithm, which combines the advantages of a level-set approach with the computational efficiency and accuracy of a parametric representation. The sparse-field algorithm is more efficient than other approaches, and because it assigns the level set to a specific set of grid points, it positions the level-set model more accurately than the grid itself. These properties, computational efficiency and subcell accuracy, are essential when trying to reconstruct the shapes of 3D objects. Results are shown for the reconstruction objects from sets of noisy and overlapping range maps.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently requires multiple procedures to achieve durable restoration of sinus rhythm. Early studies have suggested that delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) of the left atrium (LA) can assist in performing repeat ablation procedures.
OBJECTIVE
The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility of DE-MRI in delineating regions of LA low voltage and PV reconnection sites in patients undergoing repeat PV isolation for recurrent AF.
METHODS
We enrolled 10 patients undergoing repeat ablation for AF recurrence to undergo preprocedural DE-MRI of the LA in conjunction with high-density voltage mapping (\&gt;100 sites) of the LA during the ablation procedure. LA wall regions with hyperenhancement were segmented from DE-MRI images and retrospectively co-registered with the electroanatomic LA map. The association between scar on DE-MRI images and low-voltage regions of the LA was assessed, as was the association between scar gaps and electrogram-determined PV reconnection sites.
RESULTS
Ten patients underwent successful DE-MRI imaging and repeat AF ablation without complication. In all 10 patients, the majority of PVs were found to have regained electrical continuity with the LA (30/37 PVs electrically active); all patients underwent successful reisolation of all PVs using standard ablation techniques. There was a significant association between scar identified by DE-MRI and low-voltage regions of the LA ({\textendash}0.7{\textpm}0.1 mV in scar regions; generalized estimating equations model clustered by patient, P\&lt;.001). However, there was no association between scar gaps and PV reconnection sites.
CONCLUSION
We demonstrate the co-registration of DE-MRI scar imaging and electroanatomic LA mapping, with agreement between regions of scar on DE-MRI and low voltage by mapping. However, at our center, this technique did not provide accurate information on the location of PV reconnection sites in patients undergoing repeat ablation for AF.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Procedural and clinical outcomes of 573 patients who underwent their first catheter ablation for paroxysmal AF between January 2005 and April 2007 were collected from 12 centres. We evaluated three techniques: segmental ostial PV isolation (SOCA group, 240 patients), circumferential PV isolation guided by electroanatomical mapping (CARTO group, 107 patients), and circumferential PV isolation guided by electroanatomical mapping integrated with magnetic resonance/computed tomographic images of the left atrium (MERGE group, 226 patients). Procedure duration proved to be shorter in MERGE group patients than in CARTO group patients (P {\textless} 0.04), but longer than in SOCA group patients (P {\textless} 0.0001). During follow-up, atrial tachyarrhythmias relapsed more frequently in SOCA group patients (44.6\%) and CARTO group patients (41.7\%) than in MERGE group patients (22.6\%; P {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: In patients with paroxysmal AF, circumferential PV isolation guided by image integration significantly improves clinical outcome in comparison with both circumferential PV isolation guided by 3D mapping alone and with segmental electrophysiologically guided PV isolation.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. Using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. The ANN system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. Spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. Left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. In addition, ejection fractions (EF) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. Image quality was classified as good in 12 (32\%), moderate in 13 (34\%) and poor in 13 (34\%) patients. The ANN system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89\%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (R = 0.99, SEE = 1.44). A good agreement was also found for the comparison of EF between the ANN system and Tc-radionuclide ventriculography (RNV, R = 0.93, SEE = 6.36). The ANN system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. Endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. This system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.},

	abstract = {Model-based segmentation facilitates the accurate measurement of geometric properties of anatomy from ultrasound images. Regularization of the model surface is typically necessary due to the presence of noisy and incomplete boundaries. When simple regularizers are insufficient, linear basis shape models have been shown to be effective. However, for problems such as right ventricle (RV) segmentation from 3D+t echocardiography, where dense consistent landmarks and complete boundaries are absent, acquiring accurate training surfaces in dense correspondence is difficult.
As a solution, this paper presents a framework which performs joint segmentation of multiple 3D+t sequences while simultaneously optimizing an underlying linear basis shape model. In particular, the RV is represented as an explicit continuous surface, and segmentation of all frames is formulated as a single continuous energy minimization problem. Shape information is automatically shared between frames, missing boundaries are implicitly handled, and only coarse surface initializations are necessary.
The framework is demonstrated to successfully segment both multiple-view and multiple-subject collections of 3D+t echocardiography sequences, and the results confirm that the linear basis shape model is an effective model constraint. Furthermore, the framework is shown to achieve smaller segmentation errors than a state-of-art commercial semi-automatic RV segmentation package.},

	abstract = {Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) has become an important treatment method. Electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins is the cornerstone of most AF ablation procedures, and is defined by an entrance block observed on a circular multipolar electrode catheter. The safety and efficacy of AF ablation is best established in middle-aged patients with paroxysmal AF. Current guidelines recommend AF ablation with a level Ia indication in this group of patients. The long-term efficacy of AF ablation is well established in patients with paroxysmal AF, but less so in patients with longstanding persistent AF. In this population, current guidelines recommend AF ablation with a level IIb indication. The efficacy of catheter ablation in other patient populations, particularly elderly people and those with concomitant conditions, is also poorly defined. AF ablation is reasonably effective and safe at 12 months of follow-up, but recurrence of AF >=1 year after ablation is not uncommon. Fortunately, the techniques and tools used for AF ablation continue to evolve. These developments include novel ablation catheters designed to increase safety, efficacy, and precision of the procedure, ablation strategies to target both pulmonary vein and nonpulmonary vein AF triggers, and improved imaging and electrical mapping to guide ablation procedures.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash} Failure to achieve properly localized, permanent tissue destruction is a common cause of arrhythmia recurrence after cardiac ablation. Current methods of assessing lesion size and location during cardiac radiofrequency ablation are unreliable or not suited for repeated assessment during the procedure. MRI thermography could be used to delineate permanent ablation lesions because tissue heating above 50{\textdegree}C is the cause of permanent tissue destruction during radiofrequency ablation. However, image artifacts caused by cardiac motion, the ablation electrode, and radiofrequency ablation currently pose a challenge to MRI thermography in the heart. In the current study, we sought to demonstrate the feasibility of MRI thermography during cardiac ablation.
Methods and Results{\textemdash} An MRI-compatible electrophysiology catheter and filtered radiofrequency ablation system was used to perform ablation in the left ventricle of 6 mongrel dogs in a 1.5-T MRI system. Fast gradient-echo imaging was performed before and during radiofrequency ablation, and thermography images were derived from the preheating and postheating images. Lesion extent by thermography was within 20\% of the gross pathology lesion.
Conclusions{\textemdash} MR thermography appears to be a promising technique for monitoring lesion formation and may allow for more accurate placement and titration of ablation, possibly reducing arrhythmia recurrences.},

Hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and rheumatic valvular disease are the commonest causes of atrial fibrillation.

When atrial fibrillation develops, there is loss of the atrial transport factor ({\textquotedblleft}atrial kick{\textquotedblright}), with consequent decrease of cardiac output. Stroke output declines by 20-30\% in normal individuals with loss of atrial kick; the decline in stroke output is considerably larger in patients with heart disease.

Evidence from six case-control studies suggested that COC users with a history of migraine were two to four times as likely to have an ischemic stroke as nonusers with a history of migraine. The odds ratios for ischemic stroke ranged from 6 to almost 14 for COC users with migraine compared with nonusers without migraine.

	abstract = {Objective Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) has become an increasingly safe and effective therapy. This has been partly attributed to the use of adjunctive imaging modalities. We aimed to describe the use and associated outcomes of periprocedural imaging for AF ablation.
Methods We studied all Medicare fee-for-service claims for AF ablation from July 2007 to December 2009, and identified associated imaging studies before and during ablation, including transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), intracardiac echocardiography (ICE), CT and MRI. The primary outcomes were death, stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), repeat ablation, and bleeding (pericardial or vascular) at 6 months.
Results 11 525 patients underwent AF ablation during the study period. There was significant variation in imaging use at the practice level. In addition to electroanatomic mapping, 53\% (n=6060/11 525) underwent TEE, 67\% (n=7715/11 525) received ICE, and 50\% (n=5724/11 525) underwent a preprocedure CT or MRI. Imaging generally increased from 2007 to 2009. After adjustment, the use of preablation CT or MRI was associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke or TIA (0.4\% vs 0.9\%, adjusted HR 0.46, 95\% CI 0.28 to 0.74, p=0.002), and the use of ICE was associated with a lower risk of repeat ablation (5.7\% vs 8.5\%, adjusted HR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.37 to 0.92, p=0.02) but higher risk of bleeding (1.1\% vs 0.7\%, adjusted HR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.15 to 2.70, p=0.009).
Conclusions Periprocedural imaging for AF ablation is increasingly used, although practice patterns vary widely. Our data suggest that periprocedural imaging is associated with better outcomes after catheter ablation; however, prospective studies of periprocedural imaging strategies are warranted.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES

We performed noninvasive identification of post-infarction sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT)-related slow conduction channels (CC) by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (ceMRI).


BACKGROUND

Conduction channels identified by voltage mapping are the critical isthmuses of most SMVT. We hypothesized that CC are formed by heterogeneous tissue (HT) within the scar that can be detected by ceMRI.


METHODS

We studied 18 consecutive VT patients (SMVT group) and 18 patients matched for age, sex, infarct location, and left ventricular ejection fraction (control group). We used ceMRI to quantify the infarct size and differentiate it into scar core and HT based on signal-intensity (SI) thresholds ({\textgreater}3 SD and 2 to 3 SD greater than remote normal myocardium, respectively). Consecutive left ventricle slices were analyzed to determine the presence of continuous corridors of HT (channels) in the scar. In the SMVT group, color-coded shells displaying ceMRI subendocardial SI were generated (3-dimensional SI mapping) and compared with endocardial voltage maps.


RESULTS

No differences were observed between the 2 groups in myocardial, necrotic, or heterogeneous mass. The HT channels were more frequently observed in the SMVT group (88\%) than in the control group (33\%, p {\textless} 0.001). In the SMVT group, voltage mapping identified 26 CC in 17 of 18 patients. All CC corresponded, in location and orientation, to a similar channel detected by 3-dimensional SI mapping; 15 CC were related to 15 VT critical isthmuses.


CONCLUSIONS

SMVT substrate can be identified by ceMRI scar heterogeneity analysis. This information could help identify patients at risk of VT and facilitate VT ablation.},

	abstract = {Objectives~ 
    We sought to test the hypothesis that complex fractionated electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during atrial fibrillation (AF) could be used as target sites for catheter ablation of AF.Background~ 
    Mapping of AF in humans has shown that areas of CFAEs correlate with areas of slowed conduction and pivot points of reentrant wavelets. We hypothesized that such areas of CFAEs could be identified in patients with AF and might serve as target sites for catheter ablation to maintain sinus rhythm.Methods~ 
    The study population included 121 patients (29 females; mean age, 63 years) with refractory AF (57 paroxysmal, 64 chronic). All patients underwent nonfluoroscopic electroanatomic mapping (CARTO) during AF. Using CARTO, the biatrial replica, displayed in a three-dimensional color-coded voltage map, was created during AF, and areas associated with CFAEs were identified. Radiofrequency ablation of the area with CFAEs was performed, aiming to eliminate CFAE and/or convert to sinus rhythm.Results~ 
    Complex fractionated atrial electrograms were found in seven of nine regions of both atria, but were mainly confined to the interatrial septum, pulmonary veins, roof of left atrium, and left posteroseptal mitral annulus and coronary sinus ostium. Ablations of the areas associated with CFAEs resulted in termination of AF without external cardioversion in 115 of the 121 patients (95\%); 32 (28\%) required concomitant ibutilide treatment. At the one-year follow-up, 110 (91\%) patients were free of arrhythmia and symptoms, 92 after one ablation and 18 after two.Conclusions~ 
    Areas with CFAEs represent a defined electrophysiologic substrate and are ideal target sites for ablations to eliminate AF and maintain normal sinus rhythm.},

	volume = {7},
	issn = {1045-3873},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is due to multiple simultaneous wavelets of reentry in the atria. The only available curative treatment is surgical, using atriotomies to compartmentalize the atria. Therefore, we investigated a staged anatomical approach using radiofrequency catheter ablation lines to prevent paroxysmal AF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-five patients with frequent symptomatic drug-refractory episodes of paroxysmal AF were studied. Progressively complex linear lesions were created by sequential applications of radiofrequency current in the right atrium and then in the left atrium if required. The outcome of the procedure was considered a success when the episodes of AF were either eliminated or recurred at a rate of no more than one episode (lasting {\textless} 6 hours) in 3 months. Patients who had no more than one episode per month were considered "improved." Right atrial ablation organized local electrical activity and led to stable sinus rhythm during the procedure in 18 (40\%) of the 45 patients. However, sustained AF remained inducible in 40 of 45 patients, and the lesions failed to produce evidence of a significant linear conduction block/delay in all but four patients. There were no significant complications except for two transient sinus node dysfunctions. The procedure duration and fluoroscopic time were 248 +/- 79 and 53 +/- 22 min, respectively. Additional sessions were required in 19 patients to treat sustained right atrial flutter or arrhythmias linked to ectopic right or left atrial foci. During a mean follow-up of 11 +/- 4 months, right atrial ablation was successful in 15 (33\%) patients, 6 without medication and 9 with a previously ineffective drug. Nine (20\%) additional patients were improved. Ten patients with an unsuccessful outcome then underwent linear ablation in the left atrium. The procedure duration and fluoroscopy time were 292 +/- 94 and 66 +/- 24 min. A hemopericardium occurred in one patient. Two patients required reablation to treat ectopic atrial foci. Left atrial ablation terminated AF during the procedure in 8 patients, and sustained AF could not be induced in 5. Subsequent success was achieved in 6 (60\%) patients, including 4 without medication, and 1 additional patient was improved.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful radiofrequency catheter ablation of drug-refractory daily paroxysmal AF is feasible using linear atrial lesions complemented by focal ablation targeted at arrhythmogenic foci. Ablation only in the right atrium is a safe technique providing limited success, whereas linear lesions in the left atrium significantly increase the incidence of stable restoration of sinus rhythm, the inability to induce sustained AF, and the final success rate. The described technique is promising but must be considered preliminary because significant improvements are required to optimize lesion characteristics and shorten total procedure duration.},

Since the introduction of MSCT, acquisition time, detector number, spatial and temporal resolution have continuously improved with each new scanner generation, resulting in excellent image quality and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). At the same time, developments in MSCT technology have focused on reduction of the radiation dose. In particular, the availability of dose modulation and prospective ECG gating have drastically reduced patient radiation dose. Moreover, with the introduction of 320-slice MSCT, volumetric scanning of the entire heart has become possible in a single heart beat or gantry rotation, thereby eliminating oversampling and stair-step artifact. The present article provides an overview of state of the art clinical applications of cardiac MSCT, including the diagnosis of CAD, evaluation of plaque morphology and composition, prognostification, and the evaluation of left ventricular function and aortic and mitral valve anatomy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {To represent the local orientation and energy of a 1-D image signal, many models of early visual processing employ bandpass quadrature filters, formed by combining the original signal with its Hilbert transform. However, representations capable of estimating an image signal{\textquoteright}s 2-D phase have been largely ignored. Here, we consider 2-D phase representations using a method based upon the Riesz transform. For spatial images there exist two Riesz transformed signals and one original signal from which orientation, phase and energy may be represented as a vector in 3-D signal space. We show that these image properties may be represented by a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the higher-order derivatives of the original and the Riesz transformed signals. We further show that the expected responses of even and odd symmetric filters from the Riesz transform may be represented by a single signal autocorrelation function, which is beneficial in simplifying Bayesian computations for spatial orientation. Importantly, the Riesz transform allows one to weight linearly across orientation using both symmetric and asymmetric filters to account for some perceptual phase distortions observed in image signals {\textendash} notably one{\textquoteright}s perception of edge structure within plaid patterns whose component gratings are either equal or unequal in contrast. Finally, exploiting the benefits that arise from the Riesz definition of local energy as a scalar quantity, we demonstrate the utility of Riesz signal representations in estimating the spatial orientation of second-order image signals. We conclude that the Riesz transform may be employed as a general tool for 2-D visual pattern recognition by its virtue of representing phase, orientation and energy as orthogonal signal quantities.},

	abstract = {Accurate fusion of late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electro-anatomical voltage mapping (EAM) is required to evaluate the potential of MRI to identify the substrate of ventricular tachycardia. However, both datasets are not acquired at the same cardiac phase and EAM data is corrupted with respiratory motion limiting the accuracy of current rigid fusion techniques. Knowledge of cardiac and respiratory motion during EAM is thus required to enhance the fusion process. In this study, we propose a novel approach to characterize both cardiac and respiratory motion from EAM data using the temporal evolution of the 3D catheter location recorded from clinical EAM systems. Cardiac and respiratory motion components are extracted from the recorded catheter location using multi-band filters. Filters are calibrated for each EAM point using estimates of heart rate and respiratory rate. The method was first evaluated in numerical simulations using 3D models of cardiac and respiratory motions of the heart generated from real time MRI data acquired in 5 healthy subjects. An accuracy of 0.6{\textendash}0.7 mm was found for both cardiac and respiratory motion estimates in numerical simulations. Cardiac and respiratory motions were then characterized in 27 patients who underwent LV mapping for treatment of ventricular tachycardia. Mean maximum amplitude of cardiac and respiratory motion was 10.2{\textpm}2.7 mm (min?=?5.5, max?=?16.9) and 8.8{\textpm}2.3 mm (min?=?4.3, max?=?14.8), respectively. 3D Cardiac and respiratory motions could be estimated from the recorded catheter location and the method does not rely on additional imaging modality such as X-ray fluoroscopy and can be used in conventional electrophysiology laboratory setting.},

	abstract = {The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. The recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or postmyocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care. The recommendations are as follows:Recommendation 1: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2ARecommendation 2: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1ARecommendation 3: For patients with atrial fibrillation, the following drugs are recommended for their demonstrated efficacy in rate control during exercise and while at rest: atenolol, metoprolol, diltiazem, and verapamil (drugs listed alphabetically by class). Digoxin is only effective for rate control at rest and therefore should only be used as a second-line agent for rate control in atrial fibrillation. Grade: 1BRecommendation 4: For those patients who elect to undergo acute cardioversion to achieve sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation, both direct-current cardioversion (Grade: 1C+) and pharmacological conversion (Grade: 2A) are appropriate options.Recommendation 5: Both transesophageal echocardiography with short-term prior anticoagulation followed by early acute cardioversion (in the absence of intracardiac thrombus) with postcardioversion anticoagulation versus delayed cardioversion with pre- and postanticoagulation are appropriate management strategies for those patients who elect to undergo cardioversion. Grade: 2ARecommendation 6: Most patients converted to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation should not be placed on rhythm maintenance therapy since the risks outweigh the benefits. In a selected group of patients whose quality of life is compromised by atrial fibrillation, the recommended pharmacologic agents for rhythm maintenance are amiodarone, disopyramide, propafenone, and sotalol (drugs listed in alphabetical order). The choice of agent predominantly depends on specific risk of side effects based on patient characteristics. Grade: 2A},

	abstract = {A general-purpose deformable registration algorithm referred to as "DRAMMS" is presented in this paper. DRAMMS adds to the literature of registration methods that bridge between the traditional voxel-wise methods and landmark/feature-based methods. In particular, DRAMMS extracts Gabor attributes at each voxel and selects the optimal components, so that they form a highly distinctive morphological signature reflecting the anatomical context around each voxel in a multi-scale and multi-resolution fashion. Compared with intensity or mutual-information based methods, the high-dimensional optimal Gabor attributes render different anatomical regions relatively distinctively identifiable and therefore help establish more accurate and reliable correspondence. Moreover, the optimal Gabor attribute vector is constructed in a way that generalizes well, i.e., it can be applied to different registration tasks, regardless of the image contents under registration. A second characteristic of DRAMMS is that it is based on a cost function that weights different voxel pairs according to a metric referred to as "mutual-saliency", which reflects the uniqueness (reliability) of anatomical correspondences implied by the tentative transformation. As a result, image voxels do not contribute equally to the optimization process, as in most voxel-wise methods, or in a binary selection fashion, as in most landmark/feature-based methods. Instead, they contribute according to a continuously-valued mutual-saliency map, which is dynamically updated during the algorithm's evolution. The general applicability and accuracy of DRAMMS are demonstrated by experiments in simulated images, inter-subject images, single-/multi-modality images, and longitudinal images, from human and mouse brains, breast, heart, and prostate.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jacc.2011.04.008},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess acute ablation injuries seen on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) immediately post-ablation (IPA) and the association with permanent scar 3 months post-ablation (3moPA).
BACKGROUND: Success rates for atrial fibrillation catheter ablation vary significantly, in part because of limited information about the location, extent, and permanence of ablation injury at the time of procedure. Although the amount of scar on LGE MRI months after ablation correlates with procedure outcomes, early imaging predictors of scar remain elusive.
METHODS: Thirty-seven patients presenting for atrial fibrillation ablation underwent high-resolution MRI with a 3-dimensional LGE sequence before ablation, IPA, and 3moPA using a 3-T scanner. The acute left atrial wall injuries on IPA scans were categorized as hyperenhancing (HE) or nonenhancing (NE) and compared with scar 3moPA.
RESULTS: Heterogeneous injuries with HE and NE regions were identified in all patients. Dark NE regions in the left atrial wall on LGE MRI demonstrate findings similar to the "no-reflow" phenomenon. Although the left atrial wall showed similar amounts of HE, NE, and normal tissue IPA (37.7 {\textpm} 13\%, 34.3 {\textpm} 14\%, and 28.0 {\textpm} 11\%, respectively; p = NS), registration of IPA injuries with 3moPA scarring demonstrated that 59.0 {\textpm} 19\% of scar resulted from NE tissue, 30.6 {\textpm} 15\% from HE tissue, and 10.4 {\textpm} 5\% from tissue identified as normal. Paired t-test comparisons were all statistically significant among NE, HE, and normal tissue types (p {\textless} 0.001). Arrhythmia recurrence at 1-year follow-up correlated with the degree of wall enhancement 3moPA (p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency ablation results in heterogeneous injury on LGE MRI with both HE and NE wall lesions. The NE lesions demonstrate no-reflow characteristics and reveal a better predictor of final scar at 3 months. Scar correlates with procedure outcomes, further highlighting the importance of early scar prediction.},

Of the 11 extremities treated, six have shown marked improvement (four amputations averted). It is reasonable to assume that with a perfected technic and patients with less advanced disease, the percentage of successful recanalizations would increase.
Early treatment with this technic may well prevent otherwise serious disease, not just prevent amputation of extremities not suitable for definitive surgery. We are satisfied that percutaneous transluminal recanalization is the treatment of choice for many lesions of the femoral and popliteal arteries. We believe this method is ready for application to obstructions up to approximately 10 cm. by those skilled in the use of vascular catheters. No doubt the interest and ingenuity of others will lead to refinements of technic as well as further clarification of the role of this attack on arteriosclerotic obstructions.},

This ancient Greek aphorism, preserved in a fragment from the poet Archilochus, describes the central thesis of Isaiah Berlin's masterly essay on Leo Tolstoy and the philosophy of history, the subject of the epilogue to War and Peace. Although there have been many interpretations of the adage, Berlin uses it to mark a fundamental distinction between human beings who are fascinated by the infinite variety of things and those who relate everything to a central, all-embracing system. Applied to Tolstoy, the saying illuminates a paradox that helps explain his philosophy of history: Tolstoy was a fox, but believed in being a hedgehog. One of Berlin's most celebrated works, this extraordinary essay offers profound insights about Tolstoy, historical understanding, and human psychology. This new edition features a revised text that supplants all previous versions, English translations of the many passages in foreign languages, a new foreword in which Berlin biographer Michael Ignatieff explains the enduring appeal of Berlin's essay, and a new appendix that provides rich context, including excerpts from reviews and Berlin's letters, as well as a startling new interpretation of Archilochus's epigram.},

	abstract = {For late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) assessment of atrial scar to guide management and targeting of ablation in atrial fibrillation (AF), an objective, reproducible method of identifying atrial scar is required.
To describe an automated method for operator-independent quantification of LGE that correlates with colocated endocardial voltage and clinical outcomes.
LGE CMR imaging was performed at 2 centers, before and 3 months after pulmonary vein isolation for paroxysmal AF (n = 50). A left atrial (LA) surface scar map was constructed by using automated software, expressing intensity as multiples of standard deviation (SD) above blood pool mean. Twenty-one patients underwent endocardial voltage mapping at the time of pulmonary vein isolation (11 were redo procedures). Scar maps and voltage maps were spatially registered to the same magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) segmentation.
The LGE levels of 3, 4, and 5SDs above blood pool mean were associated with progressively lower bipolar voltages compared to the preceding enhancement level (0.85 {\textpm} 0.33, 0.50 {\textpm} 0.22, and 0.38 {\textpm} 0.28 mV; P = .002, P {\textless} .001, and P = .048, respectively). The proportion of atrial surface area classified as scar (ie, {\textgreater}3 SD above blood pool mean) on preablation scans was greater in patients with postablation AF recurrence than those without recurrence (6.6\% {\textpm} 6.7\% vs 3.5\% {\textpm} 3.0\%, P = .032). The LA volume {\textgreater}102 mL was associated with a significantly greater proportion of LA scar (6.4\% {\textpm} 5.9\% vs 3.4\% {\textpm} 2.2\%; P = .007).
LA scar quantified automatically by a simple objective method correlates with colocated endocardial voltage. Greater preablation scar is associated with LA dilatation and AF recurrence.},

The purpose of our study was to conduct an evidence-based evaluation of stress cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD).Background{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Stress cardiac MRI has recently emerged as a noninvasive method in the detection of CAD, with 2 main techniques in use: 1) perfusion imaging; and 2) stress-induced wall motion abnormalities imaging.

Methods

We examined studies from January 1990 to January 2007 using MEDLINE and EMBASE. A study was included if it: 1) used stress MRI as a diagnostic test for CAD ({\textgreater}=50\% diameter stenosis); and 2) used catheter X-ray angiography as the reference standard.

Results

Thirty-seven studies (2,191 patients) met the inclusion criteria, with 14 datasets (754 patients) using stress-induced wall motion abnormalities imaging and 24 datasets (1,516 patients) using perfusion imaging. Stress-induced wall motion abnormalities imaging demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.83 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 0.88) and specificity of 0.86 (95\% CI 0.81 to 0.91) on a patient level (disease prevalence = 70.5\%). Perfusion imaging demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.91 (95\% CI 0.88 to 0.94) and specificity of 0.81 (95\% CI 0.77 to 0.85) on a patient level (disease prevalence = 57.4\%).

Conclusions

In studies with high disease prevalence, stress cardiac MRI, using either technique, demonstrates overall good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD. However, limited data are available regarding use of either technique in populations with low disease prevalence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to report the results and complications of radiofrequency catheter ablation of accessory atrioventricular (AV) connections by using an abbreviated approach aimed at minimizing the duration of the procedure.
METHODS AND RESULTS Two hundred fifty consecutive patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia involving a concealed accessory AV connection underwent catheter ablation with the use of radiofrequency current. In 179 of the 250 patients, catheter ablation was performed at the time of an initial electrophysiology test. Two hundred thirty-five patients had one accessory AV connection and 15 patients had two or more. One hundred eighty-three accessory AV connections were manifest and 84 were concealed. One hundred sixty-one were were located in the free wall of the left ventricle, 47 were in the right free wall, 44 were posteroseptal, 10 were anteroseptal, and five were intermediate test, and the ablation procedure was recorded for each patient, as was the total duration of fluoroscopy. A follow-up electrophysiology test was performed 2-3 months after the ablation procedure. Ninety-four percent of patients had all accessory AV connections successfully ablated and remained free of symptomatic tachycardia during a mean follow-up of 10 +/- 4 months. Two hundred nineteen patients (88\%) had all accessory AV connections ablated during the initial attempt at catheter ablation. Mean duration of the entire procedure was 134 +/- 75 minutes. Procedure duration was longest in patients with multiple accessory AV connections, shortest in patients with intermediate septal accessory AV connections, and similar in all other locations. A nonfatal complication occurred in nine patients (4\%).
CONCLUSIONS The results of this study indicate that catheter ablation of accessory AV connections with radiofrequency current can be performed safely and expeditiously in a majority of patients and confirm in a large series the feasibility of catheter ablation at the time of an initial diagnostic electrophysiology test. This abbreviated therapeutic approach avoids the need for electropharmacological testing, long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and surgical therapy in the majority of patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or with symptomatic tachycardias involving accessory AV connections.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is still challenging, and it is unclear whether the difficulty is caused by the hypertrophy of left atrial (LA) myocardial wall thickness. The objective of the study was to compare the LA wall thickness and AF ablation outcomes between patients with HCM and those without structural heart disease.
METHODS: The present study enrolled 17 consecutive HCM patients (63 {\textpm} 12 years) with drug-refractory AF and 34 control patients without any detectable heart disease, whose age, gender, type of AF, and LA dimension were matched to the HCM patients. The myocardial wall thickness of 11 distinct LA locations, measured using 64-slice computed tomography images, and AF ablation outcomes were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The LA wall thickness did not differ at 9 of the 11 locations and was significantly thinner in the HCM patients than in the control patients at the mid-posterior wall (1.44 {\textpm} 0.17 vs. 1.58 {\textpm} 0.22, p = 0.04) and infero-posterior wall (1.62 {\textpm} 0.16 vs. 1.74 {\textpm} 0.18, p = 0.03). Although antiarrhythmic drugs were used more frequently in the HCM patients (p = 0.008), the rate of maintaining sinus rhythm during the follow-up did not differ between the HCM and control patients (53 vs. 56\% after the initial ablation [log-rank p = 0.78] and 82 and 88\% after the repeat procedure [log-rank p = 0.35]).
CONCLUSIONS: The LA wall in the HCM patients with AF was not thicker than that of the matched patients without structural heart disease. Catheter ablation of AF showed favorable outcomes in both patient groups.},

To clarify the anatomical characteristics of the LAA for risk stratification of strokes in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) who have low CHADS2 scores.
Methods
Among 80 patients who underwent catheter ablation of AF with contrast-enhanced computed tomography, the LAA characteristics were compared between 30 patients with histories of strokes and 50 age-matched controls. The LAA anatomy was classified into 4 types{\textemdash}{\textquotedblleft}cactus,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}cauliflower,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}chicken wing,{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}windsock{\textquotedblright}{\textemdash}discriminated by the computed tomography measurements of the length, angle, and number of lobes of the LAA.
Results
The average CHADS2 score did not differ significantly between patients with stroke and controls (0.8{\textpm}0.8 vs 0.6{\textpm}0.7; P = .277). Eight (26.7\%) patients with stroke had CHA2DS2-VASc scores of 0. The left atrial size, LAA flow velocity, left ventricular function, and serum brain natriuretic peptide level were also unable to predict strokes. However, a {\textquotedblleft}cauliflower{\textquotedblright} LAA, defined as a main lobe of less than 4 cm long without forked lobes, was significantly more common in patients with stroke (odds ratio 3.857; 95\% confidence interval 1.482{\textendash}10.037; P = .005). The CHA2DS2-VASc score-adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed the cauliflower LAA as an independent predictor of a stroke (odds ratio 3.355; 95\% confidence interval 1.243{\textendash}9.055; P = .017).
Conclusions
The LAA anatomy might be useful for predicting strokes in patients with nonvalvular AF who have low CHADS2 scores.},

	abstract = {Background{\textemdash}Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) naturally progresses toward chronic AF at an estimated rate of 15\% to 30\% over a 1- to 3-year period. Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation is increasingly performed for the treatment of drug-refractory paroxysmal AF. The long-term data on clinical outcome after circumferential PV isolation are limited.
Methods and Results{\textemdash}From 2003 to late 2004, 161 patients (121 men; age, 59.8{\textpm}9.7 years) with symptomatic paroxysmal AF and normal left ventricular function underwent circumferential PV isolation guided by 3-dimensional mapping and double Lasso technique. Right-sided and left-sided continuous circular lesions encircling the ipsilateral PVs were placed with irrigated radiofrequency energy. The procedure end point was the absence of all PV spikes for at least 30 minutes after PV isolation verified by 2 Lasso catheters placed within the ipsilateral PVs. Sinus rhythm was present in 75 patients (46.6\%) after the initial procedure during a median follow-up period of 4.8 years (0.33 to 5.5 years). A second procedure was performed in 66 and a third procedure in 12 patients. Recovered PV isolation conduction was observed in 62 of 66 patients (94.0\%) during the second and in 8 of 12 patients (66.7\%) during the third procedure. After a median of 1 (1 to 3) procedure, stable sinus rhythm was achieved in 128 of 161 patients (79.5\%), whereas clinical improvement occurred in an additional 21 of 161 patients (13.0\%) during a median follow-up of 4.6 years (0.33 to 5.5 years). Four patients in stable sinus rhythm died during follow-up. Progression toward chronic AF was observed in 4 patients (2.4\%); however, only 2 patients reported symptoms.
Conclusion{\textemdash}In patients with paroxysmal AF and normal left ventricular function, circumferential PV isolation results in stable sinus rhythm in the majority of patients, and low incidence of chronic AF was observed after ablation during up to 5 years of follow-up.},

	abstract = {Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) is a developing imaging modality for cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias. It reconstructs epicardial potentials, electrograms, and isochrones from electrocardiographic body-surface potentials noninvasively. Current ECGI methodology employs Tikhonov regularization, which imposes constraints on the reconstructed potentials or their derivatives. This approach can sometimes reduce spatial resolution by smoothing the solution. Accuracy depends on a priori knowledge of solution characteristics and determination of an optimal regularization parameter. These properties led us to implement an independent, iterative approach for ECGI--the generalized minimal residual (GMRes) method--which does not apply constraints. GMRes was applied to experimental data during activation/repolarization of normal and infarcted hearts. GMRes reconstructions were compared to Tikhonov reconstructions and to measured "gold standards" in isolated hearts. Overall, the accuracy of GMRes solutions was similar to Tikhonov regularization. However, in certain cases GMRes recovered localized potential features (e.g., multiple potential minima), which were lost in the Tikhonov solution. Simultaneous use of these two complementary methods in clinical ECGI will ensure reliability and maximal extraction of diagnostic information in the absence of a priori information about a patient's condition.},

SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster.

This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps.

The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF{\textquoteright}s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF{\textquoteright}s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.},

He took the same degree later at both the English universities. After his return to England he became Fellow of the College of Physicians, physician to St. Bartholomew{\textquoteright}s Hospital, and Lumleian lecturer at the College of Physicians. It was in this last capacity that he delivered, in 1616, the lectures in which he first gave public notice of his theories on the circulation of the blood. The notes of these lectures are still preserved in the British Museum.
  In 1618 Harvey was appointed physician extraordinary to James I, and he remained in close professional relations to the royal family until the close of the Civil War, being present at the battle of Edgehill. By mandate of Charles I, he was, for a short time, Warden of Merton College, Oxford (1645{\textendash}6), and, when he was too infirm to undertake the duties, he was offered the Presidency of the College of Physicians.

	abstract = {Objectives~
The goal of this study was to describe the prevalence and ablation of coronary sinus (CS) arrhythmias after left atrial ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF).Background
The CS has been implicated in a variety of supraventricular arrhythmias.Methods
Thirty-eight patients underwent mapping and ablation of atypical flutter that developed during (n = 5) or after (n = 33) ablation for AF. Also included were two patients with focal CS arrhythmias that occurred during an AF ablation procedure. A tachycardia was considered to be originating from the CS if the post-pacing interval in the CS matched the tachycardia cycle length and/or if it terminated during ablation in the CS.Results
Among the 33 patients who developed atypical flutter late after AF ablation, 9 (27\%) were found to have a CS origin. Overall, 16 of the 40 patients in this study had a CS arrhythmia. The tachycardia was macro-re-entrant in 14 patients (88\%) and focal in two patients. Radiofrequency ablation with an 8-mm-tip catheter was successful in 15 patients (94\%) without complication. In eight patients (50\%), >=45 W was required for successful ablation. Thirteen of the 15 patients (87\%) with a successful ablation acutely remained arrhythmia-free during 5 {\textpm} 5 months of follow-up.Conclusions
The musculature of the CS serves as a critical component of the re-entry circuit in approximately 25\% of patients with atypical flutter after ablation for AF. The CS may also generate focal atrial arrhythmias that may play a role in triggering and/or maintaining AF. Catheter ablation of these arrhythmias in the CS can be performed safely.},

	abstract = {Image-guided interventions are medical procedures that use computer-based systems to provide virtual image overlays to help the physician precisely visualize and target the surgical site. This field has been greatly expanded by the advances in medical imaging and computing power over the past 20 years. This review begins with a historical overview and then describes the component technologies of tracking, registration, visualization, and software. Clinical applications in neurosurgery, orthopedics, and the cardiac and thoracoabdominal areas are discussed, together with a description of an evolving technology named Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES). As the trend toward minimally invasive procedures continues, image-guided interventions will play an important role in enabling new procedures, while improving the accuracy and success of existing approaches. Despite this promise, the role of image-guided systems must be validated by clinical trials facilitated by partnerships between scientists and physicians if this field is to reach its full potential.},

	abstract = {Catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction using direct-current defibrillator discharges requires general anesthesia and may have serious side effects. Sixteen patients with drug-refractory supraventricular tachycardia underwent catheter ablation of the atrioventricular junction using radiofrequency energy. A standard 7F quadripolar electrode catheter was positioned to record the largest unipolar His potential (580 +/- 640 microV) from the distal electrode. An electrocoagulator (Microvasive Bicap 4005) supplied continuous, unmodulated energy at 550 kHz. One to 14 applications of radiofrequency current were delivered between the distal electrode and a large-diameter chest wall electrode. Transient, mild chest discomfort was reported by seven of 16 patients. None had significant arrhythmias or blood pressure changes during radiofrequency ablation. Complete atrioventricular block was produced in nine of 16 patients and high-grade second-degree atrioventricular block was produced in one patient with radiofrequency current. Attenuated His bundle electrograms could still be recorded in the remaining six patients, four of whom underwent successful atrioventricular junctional ablation using direct-current shock during the same session. Atrioventricular block persisted in all 10 patients successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation during a mean follow-up of 4.2 months. Compared with a group of historic control subjects treated with direct-current shock ablation, the 10 patients successfully treated with radiofrequency current had significantly less creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme release (5.7 +/- 5.1 vs. 22 +/- 13 IU, p = 0.006). A junctional escape rhythm was present in all patients after radiofrequency-induced atrioventricular block. In contrast, three of 10 control patients had an idioventricular escape after direct current shock ablation, and four patients had no escape rhythm at all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Model-based vision is firmly established as a robust approach to recognizing and locating known rigid objects in the presence of noise, clutter, and occlusion. It is more problematic to apply model-based methods to images of objects whose appearance can vary, though a number of approaches based on the use of flexible templates have been proposed. The problem with existing methods is that they sacrifice model specificity in order to accommodate variability, thereby compromising robustness during image interpretation. We argue that a model should only be able to deform in ways characteristic of the class of objects it represents. We describe a method for building models by learning patterns of variability from a training set of correctly annotated images. These models can be used for image search in an iterative refinement algorithm analogous to that employed by Active Contour Models (Snakes). The key difference is that our Active Shape Models can only deform to fit the data in ways consistent with the training set. We show several practical examples where we have built such models and used them to locate partially occluded objects in noisy, cluttered images.},

	abstract = {AbstractBackground
Characterization of left atrial (LA) scar using bipolar voltage (BiV) mapping is not well defined. We have previously shown that BiV range of 0.2-0.45 mV can identify chronic scar from prior pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).
Objective
This study sought to determine BiV range that can identify atrial inexcitable dense scar (IDS) in patients acutely and chronically post PVI.
Methods
Thirty consecutive patients undergoing first (n=15) or redo PVI were included. LA shell was created using electroanatomic mapping and IDS was defined by inability to capture at 10mA@2ms in sinus rhythm, circumferentially at the edge of PVI related scar (<=5mm). At each pacing site, BiV amplitude and atrial capture were recorded.
Results
Overall, 837 pacing sites were assessed. BiV predicted IDS (ROC curve area=0.93 for 1st time PVI and 0.90 for redo PVI). In 1st time PVI, the best BiV to predict IDS was 0.45mV for the LPV-LAA ridge (Sensitivity 0.98, Specificity 1.0) and 0.2mV for the other localizations (Sensitivity 0.91, Specificity 0.86). In redo PVI, the best BiV to predict IDS was 0.2mV for the LPV-LAA ridge (Sensitivity 0.77, Specificity 1.0) and 0.15mV for the other locations (Sensitivity 0.81, Specificity 0.82).
Conclusions
BiV reproducibly identifies acute and chronic IDS using a cut-off of 0.2mV (0.45mV for LPV-LAA ridge) in patients undergoing initial PVI, and 0.15mV (0.2mV for LPV-LAA ridge) in redo PVI. IDS identified thus may be a rigorous tool for validating PVI.},

	abstract = {Background
Recent reports suggest that the CartoMerge system is useful for guiding human posterior left atrial (PLA) endocardial ablation.
Objective
To assess the accuracy of the CartoMerge system during PLA ablation.
Methods
Sixteen patients undergoing PLA catheter ablation were studied. In each patient, registration of preoperative computed tomographic (CT) and intraoperative electroanatomic left atrial images was performed to create CartoMerge images. Encircling of right and left pulmonary venous vestibules with ablation points was then performed guided solely by intracardiac echocardiography, with point locations saved on a CartoMerge image to which the operator was blinded. The accuracy of the CartoMerge image was then assessed by measuring the distance from the location of each ablation point on the image to its actual anatomic location. In five patients, accuracy of registration of each of three left atrial CT images (just prior to mitral valve opening, at end-diastasis, at end-atrial contraction) with the electroanatomic image was compared. In two patients, accuracy of registration using left atrial image data alone was compared with that which used both left atrial and thoracic aorta image data.
Results
In each patient, inaccuracy of the CartoMerge image was apparent, the magnitude of which was similar for right- and left-vestibule ablation points. Accuracy was significantly improved when the end-atrial contraction CT image was used for registration. The inclusion of thoracic aorta image data did not improve accuracy.
Conclusions
The CartoMerge system is inaccurate. Inaccuracy may be reduced by using CT and electroanatomic images obtained at the same point in the atrial mechanical cycle.},
